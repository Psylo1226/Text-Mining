Yes, yes, how was it now?
Now, how
was it? To be sure! Alabin was giving a dinner at Darmstadt; no, not
Darmstadt, but something American. Yes, but then, Darmstadt was in
America. Yes, Alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables, and the
tables sang, _Il mio tesoro_—not _Il mio tesoro_ though, but something
better, and there were some sort of little decanters on the table, and
they were women, too,
Yes, it was nice, very nice. There was a great deal more that
was delightful, only there’s no putting it into words, or even
expressing it in one’s thoughts awake.
Ah, ah, ah! Oo!...
Yes, she won’t forgive me, and she can’t forgive me. And the most
awful thing about it is that it’s all my fault—all my fault, though I’m
not to blame. That’s the point of the whole situation,
Oh, oh, oh!
What’s this? this?
It’s that idiotic smile that’s to blame for it all,
But what’s to be done? What’s to be done?
Oh, it’s awful! oh dear, oh dear! awful!
And
how well things were going up till now! how well we got on! She was
contented and happy in her children; I never interfered with her in
anything; I let her manage the children and the house just as she
liked. It’s true it’s bad _her_ having been a governess in our house.
That’s bad! There’s something common, vulgar, in flirting with one’s
governess. But what a governess!
But after all, while she
was in the house, I kept myself in hand. And the worst of it all is
that she’s already ... it seems as if ill-luck would have it so! Oh,
oh! But what, what is to be done?
Then we shall see,
Are there any papers from the office?
On the table,
They’ve
sent from the carriage-jobbers.
Why do you tell me that? don’t you know?
I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or
themselves for nothing,
Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,
Thank God!
Alone, or with her husband?
Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?
Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.
Darya Alexandrovna?
Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do
what she tells you.
You want to try it on,
Yes,
sir.
Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away. Let
him do—that is you—as he likes,
Eh, Matvey?
It’s all right, sir; she will come round,
Come round?
Yes, sir.
Do you think so? Who’s there?
It’s I,
Well, what is it, Matrona?
Well, what now?
Go to her, sir; own your fault again. Maybe God will aid you. She is
suffering so, it’s sad to see her; and besides, everything in the house
is topsy-turvy. You must have pity, sir, on the children. Beg her
forgiveness, sir. There’s no help for it! One must take the
consequences....
But she won’t see me.
You do your part. God is merciful; pray to God, sir, pray to God.
Come, that’ll do, you can go,
Well now, do dress me.
in our opinion the danger
lies not in that fantastic revolutionary hydra, but in the obstinacy of
traditionalism clogging progress,
I told you not to sit passengers on the roof,
there, pick them up!
Everything’s in confusion,
there are
the children running about by themselves.
How is mamma?
Good morning,
Mamma? She is up,
That means that she’s not slept again all
night,
Well, is she cheerful?
I don’t know,
She did not say we must do our lessons, but
she said we were to go for a walk with Miss Hoole to grandmamma’s.
Well, go, Tanya, my darling. Oh, wait a minute, though,
For Grisha?
Yes, yes.
The carriage is ready,
but there’s someone to see you
with a petition.
Been here long?
Half an hour.
How many times have I told you to tell me at once?
One must let you drink your coffee in peace, at least,
Well, show the person up at once,
Ah, yes!
To go, or not to go!
It must be some time, though: it can’t go on like this,
that things cannot go on like this, that she must take some
step
Dolly!
Yes, he is happy and
content!
while I.... And that disgusting good nature,
which everyone likes him for and praises—I hate that good nature of
his,
What do you want?
Dolly!
Anna is coming
today.
Well, what is that to me? I can’t see her!
But you must, really, Dolly....
Go away, go away, go away!
My God! what have I done? Dolly! For God’s sake!... You know....
Dolly, what can I say?... One thing: forgive.... Remember, cannot nine
years of my life atone for an instant....
—instant of passion?
Go away, go out of the room!
and
don’t talk to me of your passion and your loathsomeness.
Dolly!
for mercy’s sake, think of the
children; they are not to blame! I am to blame, and punish me, make me
expiate my fault. Anything I can do, I am ready to do anything! I am to
blame, no words can express how much I am to blame! But, Dolly, forgive
me!
You remember the children, Stiva, to play with them; but I remember
them, and know that this means their ruin,
Stiva,
I think of the children, and for that reason I would do anything in
the world to save them, but I don’t myself know how to save them. By
taking them away from their father, or by leaving them with a vicious
father—yes, a vicious father.... Tell me, after what ... has happened,
can we live together? Is that possible? Tell me, eh, is it possible?
after my husband, the father of my
children, enters into a love affair with his own children’s governess?
But what could I do? what could I do?
You are loathsome to me, repulsive!
Your tears mean nothing! You have never loved me; you
have neither heart nor honorable feeling! You are hateful to me,
disgusting, a stranger—yes, a complete stranger!
No, she hates me. She will
not forgive me,
It is awful! awful!
Well, she loves my child,
my child: how can she hate me?
Dolly, one word more,
If you come near me, I will call in the servants, the children! They
may all know you are a scoundrel! I am going away at once, and you may
live here with your mistress!
Matvey says she will come round; but how? I
don’t see the least chance of it. Ah, oh, how horrible it is! And how
vulgarly she shouted,
scoundrel
mistress.
And very likely the maids were
listening! Horribly vulgar! horrible!
that the German was wound up for a whole
lifetime himself, to wind up watches,
And maybe she will come round! That’s
a good expression, ‘_come round,_’
I must repeat that.
Matvey!
Arrange everything with Darya in the sitting
room for Anna Arkadyevna,
Yes, sir.
You won’t dine at home?
That’s as it happens. But here’s for the housekeeping,
That’ll be enough.
Enough or not enough, we must make it do,
What were the
children to put on for their walk? Should they have any milk? Should
not a new cook be sent for?
Ah, let me alone, let me alone!
He has gone! But has he broken it off with her?
Can it be he sees her? Why didn’t I ask him! No, no,
reconciliation is impossible. Even if we remain in the same house, we
are strangers—strangers forever!
And how I loved him! my God,
how I loved him!... How I loved him! And now don’t I love him? Don’t I
love him more than before? The most horrible thing is,
Let us send for my brother,
he can get a dinner anyway, or
we shall have the children getting nothing to eat till six again, like
yesterday.
Very well, I will come directly and see about it. But did you send for
some new milk?
Aha! Stiva! Oblonsky! Here he is!
We have succeeded in getting the information from the government
department of Penza. Here, would you care?...
You’ve got them at last?
Now, gentlemen....
If they knew,
what a guilty little boy their president
was half an hour ago.
We shall have time to finish after lunch,
To be sure we shall!
A pretty sharp fellow this Fomin must be,
Who was that came in?
Someone, your excellency, crept in without permission directly my back
was turned. He was asking for you. I told him: when the members come
out, then....
Where is he?
Maybe he’s gone into the passage, but here he comes anyway. That is
he,
Why, it’s actually you, Levin, at last!
How is it you have
deigned to look me up in this den?
Have you been here
long?
I have just come, and very much wanted to see you,
Well, let’s go into my room,
We have long been expecting you,
I am very, very glad to see you,
Well,
how are you? Eh? When did you come?
Ah, to be sure, let me introduce you,
My colleagues: Philip
Ivanitch Nikitin, Mihail Stanislavitch Grinevitch
a district councilor, a modern district councilman, a gymnast
who lifts thirteen stone with one hand, a cattle-breeder and sportsman,
and my friend, Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, the brother of Sergey
Ivanovitch Koznishev.
Delighted,
I have the honor of knowing your brother, Sergey Ivanovitch,
No, I am no longer a district councilor. I have quarreled with them
all, and don’t go to the meetings any more,
You’ve been quick about it!
But how?
why?
It’s a long story. I will tell you some time,
Well, to put it shortly, I was convinced
that nothing was really done by the district councils, or ever could
be,
On one side
it’s a plaything; they play at being a parliament, and I’m neither
young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings; and on the
other side
it’s a means for the coterie of the
district to make money. Formerly they had wardships, courts of justice,
now they have the district council—not in the form of bribes, but in
the form of unearned salary,
Aha! You’re in a new phase again, I see—a conservative,
However, we can go into that later.
Yes, later. But I wanted to see you,
How was it you used to say you would never wear European dress again?
Ah!
I see: a new phase.
Oh, where shall we meet? You know I want very much to talk to you,
I’ll tell you what: let’s go to Gurin’s to lunch, and there we can
talk. I am free till three.
No,
I have got to go on
somewhere else.
All right, then, let’s dine together.
Dine together? But I have nothing very particular, only a few words to
say, and a question I want to ask you, and we can have a talk
afterwards.
Well, say the few words, then, at once, and we’ll gossip after
dinner.
Well, it’s this,
but it’s of no importance, though.
What are the Shtcherbatskys doing? Everything as it used to be?
You said a few words, but I can’t answer in a few words, because....
Excuse me a minute....
No, you do as I told you,
So do it that way, if you please, Zahar
Nikititch.
I don’t understand it, I don’t understand it,
What don’t you understand?
I don’t understand what you are doing,
How can you do it seriously?
Why not?
Why, because there’s nothing in it.
You think so, but we’re overwhelmed with work.
On paper. But, there, you’ve a gift for it,
That’s to say, you think there’s a lack of something in me?
Perhaps so,
But all the same I admire your grandeur, and
am proud that I’ve a friend in such a great person. You’ve not answered
my question, though,
Oh, that’s all very well. You wait a bit, and you’ll come to this
yourself. It’s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the
Karazinsky district, and such muscles, and the freshness of a girl of
twelve; still you’ll be one of us one day. Yes, as to your question,
there is no change, but it’s a pity you’ve been away so long.
Oh, why so?
Oh, nothing,
We’ll talk it over. But what’s
brought you up to town?
Oh, we’ll talk about that, too, later on,
All right. I see,
I should ask you to come
to us, you know, but my wife’s not quite the thing. But I tell you
what; if you want to see them, they’re sure now to be at the Zoological
Gardens from four to five. Kitty skates. You drive along there, and
I’ll come and fetch you, and we’ll go and dine somewhere together.
Capital. So good-bye till then.
Now mind, you’ll forget, I know you, or rush off home to the country!
No, truly!
That gentleman must be a man of great energy,
Yes, my dear boy,
he’s a
lucky fellow! Over six thousand acres in the Karazinsky district;
everything before him; and what youth and vigor! Not like some of us.
You have a great deal to complain of, haven’t you, Stepan
Arkadyevitch?
Ah, yes, I’m in a poor way, a bad way,
I have come to make your sister-in-law an offer,
I cannot admit it,
I cannot
in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external
world has been derived from perceptions. The most fundamental idea, the
idea of existence, has not been received by me through sensation;
indeed, there is no special sense-organ for the transmission of such an
idea.
Yes, but they—Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov—would answer that your
consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your
sensations, that that consciousness of existence is the result of your
sensations. Wurt, indeed, says plainly that, assuming there are no
sensations, it follows that there is no idea of existence.
I maintain the contrary,
According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I
can have no existence of any sort?
That question we have no right to answer as yet.
We have not the requisite data,
No,
I would point out the fact that
if, as Pripasov directly asserts, perception is based on sensation,
then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two
conceptions.
Delighted that you’ve come. For some time, is it? How’s your farming
getting on?
Well, how is your district council doing?
I really don’t know.
What! Why, surely you’re a member of the board?
No, I’m not a member now; I’ve resigned,
and I no
longer attend the meetings.
What a pity!
That’s how it always is!
We
Russians are always like that. Perhaps it’s our strong point, really,
the faculty of seeing our own shortcomings; but we overdo it, we
comfort ourselves with irony which we always have on the tip of our
tongues. All I say is, give such rights as our local self-government to
any other European people—why, the Germans or the English would have
worked their way to freedom from them, while we simply turn them into
ridicule.
But how can it be helped?
It was my last
effort. And I did try with all my soul. I can’t. I’m no good at it.
It’s not that you’re no good at it,
it is
that you don’t look at it as you should.
Perhaps not,
Oh! do you know brother Nikolay’s turned up again?
What did you say?
How do you know?
Prokofy saw him in the street.
Here in Moscow? Where is he? Do you know?
I am sorry I told you,
I sent to find out where he is
living, and sent him his IOU to Trubin, which I paid. This is the
answer he sent me.
I humbly beg you to
leave me in peace. That’s the only favor I ask of my gracious
brothers.—Nikolay Levin.
He obviously wants to offend me,
but he
cannot offend me, and I should have wished with all my heart to assist
him, but I know it’s impossible to do that.
Yes, yes,
I understand and appreciate your attitude
to him; but I shall go and see him.
If you want to, do; but I shouldn’t advise it,
As regards myself, I have no fear of your doing so; he
will not make you quarrel with me; but for your own sake, I should say
you would do better not to go. You can’t do him any good; still, do as
you please.
Very likely I can’t do any good, but I feel—especially at such a
moment—but that’s another thing—I feel I could not be at peace.
Well, that I don’t understand,
One thing I
do understand,
it’s a lesson in humility. I have come to
look very differently and more charitably on what is called infamous
since brother Nikolay has become what he is ... you know what he
did....
Oh, it’s awful, awful!
You mustn’t be excited, you must be calm. What’s the matter
with you? What do you want? Be quiet, stupid,
Is it possible I can go over
there on the ice, go up to her?
Ah, the first skater in Russia! Been here long? First-rate ice—do put
your skates on.
I haven’t got my skates,
Have you been here long?
Thank you,
I? I’ve not long ... yesterday ... I mean today ... I arrived,
I was meaning to come and see you,
I didn’t know you could skate, and skate so well.
Your praise is worth having. The tradition is kept up here that you
are the best of skaters,
Yes, I used once to skate with passion; I wanted to reach perfection.
You do everything with passion, I think,
I should
so like to see how you skate. Put on skates, and let us skate
together.
Skate together! Can that be possible?
I’ll put them on directly,
It’s a long while since we’ve seen you here, sir,
Except
you, there’s none of the gentlemen first-rate skaters. Will that be all
right?
Oh, yes, yes; make haste, please,
Yes,
this now is life, this is happiness! _Together,_
she said; _let us skate together!_ Speak to her now? But that’s just
why I’m afraid to speak—because I’m happy now, happy in hope,
anyway.... And then?... But I must! I must! I must! Away with
weakness!
With you I should soon learn; I somehow feel confidence in you,
And I have confidence in myself when you are leaning on me,
Is there anything troubling you?—though I’ve no right to ask such a
question,
Oh, why so?... No, I have nothing to trouble me,
You haven’t seen Mlle. Linon, have
you?
Not yet.
Go and speak to her, she likes you so much.
What’s wrong? I have offended her. Lord help me!
Yes, you see we’re growing up,
and growing old. _Tiny bear_ has grown big now!
Do you remember that’s what you used to call them?
Now, go and skate, go and skate. Our Kitty has learned to skate
nicely, hasn’t she?
Surely you must be dull in the country in the winter, aren’t you?
No, I’m not dull, I am very busy,
Are you going to stay in town long?
I don’t know,
How is it you don’t know?
I don’t know. It depends upon you,
My God! what have I done! Merciful God! help me, guide me,
Ah, that’s a new trick!
Don’t break your neck! it needs practice!
How splendid, how nice he is!
And
can it be my fault, can I have done anything wrong? They talk of
flirtation. I know it’s not he that I love; but still I am happy with
him, and he’s so jolly. Only, why did he say that?...
Delighted to see you,
On Thursdays we
are home, as always.
Today, then?
We shall be pleased to see you,
Good-bye till this evening.
Well, shall we set off?
I’ve been thinking about you all
this time, and I’m very, very glad you’ve come,
Yes, come along,
Good-bye till this evening,
To the England or the Hermitage?
I don’t mind which.
All right, then, the England,
Have you got a sledge?
That’s first-rate, for I sent my carriage home.
Good-bye till this evening.
You like turbot, don’t you?
Eh?
Turbot? Yes, I’m _awfully_ fond of turbot.
This way, your excellency, please. Your excellency won’t be disturbed
here,
Walk in, your
excellency,
If you prefer it, your excellency, a private room will be free
directly; Prince Golistin with a lady. Fresh oysters have come in.
Ah! oysters.
How if we were to change our program, Levin?
Are the oysters good? Mind now.
They’re Flensburg, your excellency. We’ve no Ostend.
Flensburg will do, but are they fresh?
Only arrived yesterday.
Well, then, how if we were to begin with oysters, and so change the
whole program? Eh?
It’s all the same to me. I should like cabbage soup and porridge
better than anything; but of course there’s nothing like that here.
_Porridge à la Russe,_ your honor would like?
No, joking apart, whatever you choose is sure to be good. I’ve been
skating, and I’m hungry. And don’t imagine,
that I shan’t appreciate your
choice. I am fond of good things.
I should hope so! After all, it’s one of the pleasures of life,
Well, then, my friend, you give us two—or better
say three—dozen oysters, clear soup with vegetables....
_Printanière,_
With vegetables in it, you know. Then turbot with thick sauce, then
... roast beef; and mind it’s good. Yes, and capons, perhaps, and then
sweets.
_Soupe printanière, turbot, sauce
Beaumarchais, poulard à l’estragon, macédoine de fruits_ ... etc.,
What shall we drink?
What you like, only not too much. Champagne,
What! to start with? You’re right though, I dare say. Do you like the
white seal?
_Cachet blanc,_
Very well, then, give us that brand with the oysters, and then we’ll
see.
Yes, sir. And what table wine?
You can give us Nuits. Oh, no, better the classic Chablis.
Yes, sir. And _your_ cheese, your excellency?
Oh, yes, Parmesan. Or would you like another?
No, it’s all the same to me,
Not bad,
Not bad,
You don’t care much for oysters, do you?
or you’re worried about something. Eh?
I? Yes, I am; but besides, all this bothers me,
You can’t
conceive how queer it all seems to a country person like me, as queer
as that gentleman’s nails I saw at your place....
Yes, I saw how much interested you were in poor Grinevitch’s nails,
It’s too much for me,
Do try, now, and put yourself
in my place, take the point of view of a country person. We in the
country try to bring our hands into such a state as will be most
convenient for working with. So we cut our nails; sometimes we turn up
our sleeves. And here people purposely let their nails grow as long as
they will, and link on small saucers by way of studs, so that they can
do nothing with their hands.
Oh, yes, that’s just a sign that he has no need to do coarse work. His
work is with the mind....
Maybe. But still it’s queer to me, just as at this moment it seems
queer to me that we country folks try to get our meals over as soon as
we can, so as to be ready for our work, while here are we trying to
drag out our meal as long as possible, and with that object eating
oysters....
Why, of course,
But that’s just the
aim of civilization—to make everything a source of enjoyment.
Well, if that’s its aim, I’d rather be a savage.
And so you are a savage. All you Levins are savages.
Oh, I say, are you going tonight to our people, the Shtcherbatskys’, I
mean?
Yes, I shall certainly go,
though I fancied the
princess was not very warm in her invitation.
What nonsense! That’s her manner.... Come, boy, the soup!... That’s
her manner—_grande dame,_
I’m coming, too,
but I have to go to the Countess Bonina’s rehearsal. Come, isn’t it
true that you’re a savage? How do you explain the sudden way in which
you vanished from Moscow? The Shtcherbatskys were continually asking me
about you, as though I ought to know. The only thing I know is that you
always do what no one else does.
Yes,
you’re right. I am a
savage. Only, my savageness is not in having gone away, but in coming
now. Now I have come....
Oh, what a lucky fellow you are!
Why?
‘I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,

And by his eyes I know a youth in love,’
Everything is before you.
Why, is it over for you already?
No; not over exactly, but the future is yours, and the present is
mine, and the present—well, it’s not all that it might be.
How so?
Oh, things go wrong. But I don’t want to talk of myself, and besides I
can’t explain it all,
Well, why have you
come to Moscow, then?... Hi! take away!
You guess?
I guess, but I can’t be the first to talk about it. You can see by
that whether I guess right or wrong,
Well, and what have you to say to me?
How do you look at the question?
I?
there’s nothing I desire so much as
that—nothing! It would be the best thing that could be.
But you’re not making a mistake? You know what we’re speaking of?
You think it’s possible?
I think it’s possible. Why not possible?
No! do you really think it’s possible? No, tell me all you think! Oh,
but if ... if refusal’s in store for me!... Indeed I feel sure....
Why should you think that?
It seems so to me sometimes. That will be awful for me, and for her
too.
Oh, well, anyway there’s nothing awful in it for a girl. Every girl’s
proud of an offer.
Yes, every girl, but not she.
Stay, take some sauce,
No, stop a minute, stop a minute,
You must understand that
it’s a question of life and death for me. I have never spoken to anyone
of this. And there’s no one I could speak of it to, except you. You
know we’re utterly unlike each other, different tastes and views and
everything; but I know you’re fond of me and understand me, and that’s
why I like you awfully. But for God’s sake, be quite straightforward
with me.
I tell you what I think,
But I’ll
say more: my wife is a wonderful woman....
She has a gift of foreseeing things. She sees right through
people; but that’s not all; she knows what will come to pass,
especially in the way of marriages. She foretold, for instance, that
Princess Shahovskaya would marry Brenteln. No one would believe it, but
it came to pass. And she’s on your side.
How do you mean?
It’s not only that she likes you—she says that Kitty is certain to be
your wife.
She says that!
I always said she was exquisite, your
wife. There, that’s enough, enough said about it,
All right, but do sit down.
You must understand,
it’s not love. I’ve been in love, but
it’s not that. It’s not my feeling, but a sort of force outside me has
taken possession of me. I went away, you see, because I made up my mind
that it could never be, you understand, as a happiness that does not
come on earth; but I’ve struggled with myself, I see there’s no living
without it. And it must be settled.
What did you go away for?
Ah, stop a minute! Ah, the thoughts that come crowding on one! The
questions one must ask oneself! Listen. You can’t imagine what you’ve
done for me by what you said. I’m so happy that I’ve become positively
hateful; I’ve forgotten everything. I heard today that my brother
Nikolay ... you know, he’s here ... I had even forgotten him. It seems
to me that he’s happy too. It’s a sort of madness. But one thing’s
awful.... Here, you’ve been married, you know the feeling ... it’s
awful that we—old—with a past ... not of love, but of sins ... are
brought all at once so near to a creature pure and innocent; it’s
loathsome, and that’s why one can’t help feeling oneself unworthy.
Oh, well, you’ve not many sins on your conscience.
Alas! all the same,
when with loathing I go over my
life, I shudder and curse and bitterly regret it.... Yes.
What would you have? The world’s made so,
The one comfort is like that prayer, which I always liked: ‘Forgive me
not according to my unworthiness, but according to Thy
loving-kindness.’ That’s the only way she can forgive me.
There’s one other thing I ought to tell you. Do you know Vronsky?
No, I don’t. Why do you ask?
Give us another bottle,
Why you ought to know Vronsky is that he’s one of your rivals.
Who’s Vronsky?
Vronsky is one of the sons of Count Kirill Ivanovitch Vronsky, and one
of the finest specimens of the gilded youth of Petersburg. I made his
acquaintance in Tver when I was there on official business, and he came
there for the levy of recruits. Fearfully rich, handsome, great
connections, an aide-de-camp, and with all that a very nice,
good-natured fellow. But he’s more than simply a good-natured fellow,
as I’ve found out here—he’s a cultivated man, too, and very
intelligent; he’s a man who’ll make his mark.
Well, he turned up here soon after you’d gone, and as I can see, he’s
over head and ears in love with Kitty, and you know that her
mother....
Excuse me, but I know nothing,
You wait a bit, wait a bit,
I’ve told you what I know, and I repeat that in
this delicate and tender matter, as far as one can conjecture, I
believe the chances are in your favor.
But I would advise you to settle the thing as soon as may be,
No, thanks, I can’t drink any more,
I shall be drunk.... Come, tell me how are you getting on?
One word more: in any case I advise you to settle the question soon.
Tonight I don’t advise you to speak,
Go
round tomorrow morning, make an offer in due form, and God bless
you....
Oh, do you still think of coming to me for some shooting? Come next
spring, do,
I’ll come some day,
But women, my boy, they’re the pivot
everything turns upon. Things are in a bad way with me, very bad. And
it’s all through women. Tell me frankly now,
give me your advice.
Why, what is it?
I’ll tell you. Suppose you’re married, you love your wife, but you’re
fascinated by another woman....
Excuse me, but I’m absolutely unable to comprehend how ... just as I
can’t comprehend how I could now, after my dinner, go straight to a
baker’s shop and steal a roll.
Why not? A roll will sometimes smell so good one can’t resist it.
Himmlisch ist’s, wenn ich bezwungen

    Meine irdische Begier;

Aber doch wenn’s nich gelungen

    Hatt’ ich auch recht hübsch Plaisir!
Yes, but joking apart,
you must
understand that the woman is a sweet, gentle loving creature, poor and
lonely, and has sacrificed everything. Now, when the thing’s done,
don’t you see, can one possibly cast her off? Even supposing one parts
from her, so as not to break up one’s family life, still, can one help
feeling for her, setting her on her feet, softening her lot?
Well, you must excuse me there. You know to me all women are divided
into two classes ... at least no ... truer to say: there are women and
there are ... I’ve never seen exquisite fallen beings, and I never
shall see them, but such creatures as that painted Frenchwoman at the
counter with the ringlets are vermin to my mind, and all fallen women
are the same.
But the Magdalen?
Ah, drop that! Christ would never have said those words if He had
known how they would be abused. Of all the Gospel those words are the
only ones remembered. However, I’m not saying so much what I think, as
what I feel. I have a loathing for fallen women. You’re afraid of
spiders, and I of these vermin. Most likely you’ve not made a study of
spiders and don’t know their character; and so it is with me.
It’s very well for you to talk like that; it’s very much like that
gentleman in Dickens who used to fling all difficult questions over his
right shoulder. But to deny the facts is no answer. What’s to be
done—you tell me that, what’s to be done? Your wife gets older, while
you’re full of life. Before you’ve time to look round, you feel that
you can’t love your wife with love, however much you may esteem her.
And then all at once love turns up, and you’re done for, done for,
Yes, you’re done for,
But what’s to be done?
Don’t steal rolls.
Oh, moralist! But you must understand, there are two women; one
insists only on her rights, and those rights are your love, which you
can’t give her; and the other sacrifices everything for you and asks
for nothing. What are you to do? How are you to act? There’s a fearful
tragedy in it.
If you care for my profession of faith as regards that, I’ll tell you
that I don’t believe there was any tragedy about it. And this is why.
To my mind, love ... both the sorts of love, which you remember Plato
defines in his Banquet, served as the test of men. Some men only
understand one sort, and some only the other. And those who only know
the non-platonic love have no need to talk of tragedy. In such love
there can be no sort of tragedy. ‘I’m much obliged for the
gratification, my humble respects’—that’s all the tragedy. And in
platonic love there can be no tragedy, because in that love all is
clear and pure, because....
But perhaps you are right. Very likely ... I don’t know, I don’t
know.
It’s this, don’t you see,
you’re very much
all of a piece. That’s your strong point and your failing. You have a
character that’s all of a piece, and you want the whole of life to be
of a piece too—but that’s not how it is. You despise public official
work because you want the reality to be invariably corresponding all
the while with the aim—and that’s not how it is. You want a man’s work,
too, always to have a defined aim, and love and family life always to
be undivided—and that’s not how it is. All the variety, all the charm,
all the beauty of life is made up of light and shadow.
Bill!
You see
I was right.
It’s as well he’s not
attractive enough for Kitty to have fallen in love with him,
Marriages aren’t made nowadays as they used to be,
Mercy on us, it’s high time in our day to
cast off all that old-fashioned business. It’s the young people have to
marry; and not their parents; and so we ought to leave the young people
to arrange it as they choose.
And just now, I am impatiently awaiting my
mother’s arrival from Petersburg, as peculiarly fortunate,
Why, has he been here long?
He came today, mamma.
There’s one thing I want to say....
Mamma,
please,
please don’t say anything about that. I know, I know all about it.
I only want to say that to raise hopes....
Mamma, darling, for goodness’ sake, don’t talk about it. It’s so
horrible to talk about it.
I won’t,
but one thing, my love; you promised me you would have no secrets from
me. You won’t?
Never, mamma, none,
but there’s no use in my telling you
anything, and I ... I ... if I wanted to, I don’t know what to say or
how.... I don’t know....
No, she could not tell an untruth with those eyes,
Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin.
So it
is to be,
My God! shall I myself really have to say it to him?
Can I tell him I don’t love him? That will be a lie. What am I to say
to him? That I love someone else? No, that’s impossible. I’m going
away, I’m going away.
No! it’s not
honest. What have I to be afraid of? I have done nothing wrong. What is
to be, will be! I’ll tell the truth. And with him one can’t be ill at
ease. Here he is,
It’s not time yet; I think I’m too early,
Oh, no,
But this was just what I wanted, to find you alone,
Mamma will be down directly. She was very much tired....
Yesterday....
I told you I did not know whether I should be here long ... that it
depended on you....
That it depended on you,
I meant to say ... I meant to
say ... I came for this ... to be my wife!
That cannot be ... forgive me.
It was bound to be so,
Thank God, she has refused him,
I do like it when he looks down at me from the height of his grandeur,
or breaks off his learned conversation with me because I’m a fool, or
is condescending to me. I like that so; to see him condescending! I am
so glad he can’t bear me,
Ah, Konstantin Dmitrievitch! So you’ve come back to our corrupt
Babylon,
Come, is Babylon reformed, or have you degenerated?
It’s very flattering for me, countess, that you remember my words so
well,
They must certainly make a great impression on
you.
Oh, I should think so! I always note them all down. Well, Kitty, have
you been skating again?...
Shall you be long in Moscow? You’re busy with the district council,
though, aren’t you, and can’t be away for long?
No, princess, I’m no longer a member of the council,
I have
come up for a few days.
There’s something the matter with him,
He isn’t in his old argumentative
mood. But I’ll draw him out. I do love making a fool of him before
Kitty, and I’ll do it.
Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
do explain to me, please,
what’s the meaning of it. You know all about such things. At home in
our village of Kaluga all the peasants and all the women have drunk up
all they possessed, and now they can’t pay us any rent. What’s the
meaning of that? You always praise the peasants so.
Excuse me, countess, but I really know nothing about it, and can’t
tell you anything,
That must be Vronsky,
Let me introduce you,
Konstantin Dmitrievitch Levin, Count Alexey Kirillovitch Vronsky.
I believe I was to have dined with you this winter,
but you had unexpectedly left for the
country.
Konstantin Dmitrievitch despises and hates town and us townspeople,
My words must make a deep impression on you, since you remember them
so well,
Are you always in the country?
I should think it must
be dull in the winter.
It’s not dull if one has work to do; besides, one’s not dull by
oneself,
I am fond of the country,
But I hope, count, you would not consent to live in the country
always,
I don’t know; I have never tried for long. I experienced a queer
feeling once,
I never longed so for the country, Russian
country, with bast shoes and peasants, as when I was spending a winter
with my mother in Nice. Nice itself is dull enough, you know. And
indeed, Naples and Sorrento are only pleasant for a short time. And
it’s just there that Russia comes back to me most vividly, and
especially the country. It’s as though....
Now go,
Ah, countess, you really must take me, for pity’s sake do take me to
see them! I have never seen anything extraordinary, though I am always
on the lookout for it everywhere,
Very well, next Saturday,
But you,
Konstantin Dmitrievitch, do you believe in it?
Why do you ask me? You know what I shall say.
But I want to hear your opinion.
My opinion,
is only that this table-turning simply
proves that educated society—so called—is no higher than the peasants.
They believe in the evil eye, and in witchcraft and omens, while
we....
Oh, then you don’t believe in it?
I can’t believe in it, countess.
But if I’ve seen it myself?
The peasant women too tell us they have seen goblins.
Then you think I tell a lie?
Oh, no, Masha, Konstantin Dmitrievitch said he could not believe in
it,
You do not admit the conceivability at all?
But why not?
We admit the existence of electricity, of which we know nothing. Why
should there not be some new force, still unknown to us, which....
When electricity was discovered,
it was
only the phenomenon that was discovered, and it was unknown from what
it proceeded and what were its effects, and ages passed before its
applications were conceived. But the spiritualists have begun with
tables writing for them, and spirits appearing to them, and have only
later started saying that it is an unknown force.
Yes, but the spiritualists say we don’t know at present what this
force is, but there is a force, and these are the conditions in which
it acts. Let the scientific men find out what the force consists in.
No, I don’t see why there should not be a new force, if it....
Why, because with electricity,
every time
you rub tar against wool, a recognized phenomenon is manifested, but in
this case it does not happen every time, and so it follows it is not a
natural phenomenon.
Do let us try at once, countess,
I think,
that this attempt of the spiritualists to
explain their marvels as some sort of new natural force is most futile.
They boldly talk of spiritual force, and then try to subject it to
material experiment.
And I think you would be a first-rate medium,
there’s something enthusiastic in you.
Do let us try table-turning at once, please,
Princess,
will you allow it?
If you can
forgive me, forgive me,
I am so happy.
I hate them all, and you, and myself,
Ah!
Been here long, my boy? I didn’t even know
you were in town. Very glad to see you.
Prince, let us have Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
we want to try an experiment.
What experiment? Table-turning? Well, you must excuse me, ladies and
gentlemen, but to my mind it is better fun to play the ring game,
There’s some sense in that, anyway.
I hope you will be there?
I’m sorry, I’m sorry; but what
could I do? It’s not my fault,
Lord, have pity on us; Lord, have pity on us;
Lord, have pity on us!
What? I’ll tell you what!
That
you’ve no pride, no dignity; that you’re disgracing, ruining your
daughter by this vulgar, stupid matchmaking!
But, really, for mercy’s sake, prince, what have I done?
What have you done? I’ll tell you what. First of all, you’re trying to
catch an eligible gentleman, and all Moscow will be talking of it, and
with good reason. If you have evening parties, invite everyone, don’t
pick out the possible suitors. Invite all the young bucks. Engage a
piano player, and let them dance, and not as you do things nowadays,
hunting up good matches. It makes me sick, sick to see it, and you’ve
gone on till you’ve turned the poor wench’s head. Levin’s a thousand
times the better man. As for this little Petersburg swell, they’re
turned out by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish.
But if he were a prince of the blood, my daughter need not run after
anyone.
But what have I done?
Why, you’ve....
I know if one were to listen to you,
we
should never marry our daughter. If it’s to be so, we’d better go into
the country.
Well, and we had better.
But do wait a minute. Do I try and catch them? I don’t try to catch
them in the least. A young man, and a very nice one, has fallen in love
with her, and she, I fancy....
Oh, yes, you fancy! And how if she really is in love, and he’s no more
thinking of marriage than I am!... Oh, that I should live to see it!
Ah! spiritualism! Ah! Nice! Ah! the ball!
And this is how we’re preparing wretchedness for Kitty; and she’s
really got the notion into her head....
But what makes you suppose so?
I don’t suppose; I know. We have eyes for such things, though
women-folk haven’t. I see a man who has serious intentions, that’s
Levin: and I see a peacock, like this feather-head, who’s only amusing
himself.
Oh, well, when once you get an idea into your head!...
Well, you’ll remember my words, but too late, just as with Dolly.
Well, well, we won’t talk of it,
By all means, and good-night!
Lord, have pity; Lord,
have pity; Lord, have pity.
What is so exquisite,
what is so exquisite is that not a word
has been said by me or by her, but we understand each other so well in
this unseen language of looks and tones, that this evening more clearly
than ever she told me she loves me. And how secretly, simply, and most
of all, how trustfully! I feel myself better, purer. I feel that I have
a heart, and that there is a great deal of good in me. Those sweet,
loving eyes! When she said: ‘Indeed I do....’

“Well, what then? Oh, nothing. It’s good for me, and good for her.
Club? a game of
bezique, champagne with Ignatov? No, I’m not going. _Château des
Fleurs_; there I shall find Oblonsky, songs, the cancan. No, I’m sick
of it. That’s why I like the Shtcherbatskys’, that I’m growing better.
I’ll go home.
Ah! your excellency!
whom are you meeting?
My mother,
She is to be here from Petersburg today.
I was looking out for you till two o’clock last night. Where did you
go after the Shtcherbatskys’?
Home,
I must own I felt so well content yesterday
after the Shtcherbatskys’ that I didn’t care to go anywhere.
I know a gallant steed by tokens sure,

And by his eyes I know a youth in love,
And whom are you meeting?
I? I’ve come to meet a pretty woman,
You don’t say so!
_Honi soit qui mal y pense!_ My sister Anna.
Ah! that’s Madame Karenina,
You know her, no doubt?
I think I do. Or perhaps not ... I really am not sure,
But Alexey Alexandrovitch, my celebrated brother-in-law, you surely
must know. All the world knows him.
I know him by reputation and by sight. I know that he’s clever,
learned, religious somewhat.... But you know that’s not ... _not in my
line,_
Yes, he’s a very remarkable man; rather a conservative, but a splendid
man,
a splendid man.
Oh, well, so much the better for him,
Oh,
you’ve come,
come here.
Well, what do you say? Shall we give a supper on Sunday for the
_diva?_
Of course. I’m collecting subscriptions. Oh, did you make the
acquaintance of my friend Levin?
Yes; but he left rather early.
He’s a capital fellow,
Isn’t he?
I don’t know why it is,
in all Moscow
people—present company of course excepted,
there’s something uncompromising. They are all on the defensive, lose
their tempers, as though they all want to make one feel something....
Yes, that’s true, it is so,
Will the train soon be in?
The train’s signaled,
No,
No, you’ve not got a
true impression of Levin. He’s a very nervous man, and is sometimes out
of humor, it’s true, but then he is often very nice. He’s such a true,
honest nature, and a heart of gold. But yesterday there were special
reasons,
Yes,
there were reasons why he could not help being either particularly
happy or particularly unhappy.
How so? Do you mean he made
your _belle-sœur_ an offer yesterday?
Maybe,
I fancied something of the sort
yesterday. Yes, if he went away early, and was out of humor too, it
must mean it.... He’s been so long in love, and I’m very sorry for
him.
So that’s it! I should imagine, though, she might reckon on a better
match,
though I don’t know him, of course,
Yes, that is a hateful
position! That’s why most fellows prefer to have to do with Klaras. If
you don’t succeed with them it only proves that you’ve not enough cash,
but in this case one’s dignity’s at stake. But here’s the train.
Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment,
You got my telegram? Quite well? Thank God.
You had a good journey?
All the same I don’t agree with you,
It’s the Petersburg view, madame.
Not Petersburg, but simply feminine,
Well, well, allow me to kiss your hand.
Good-bye, Ivan Petrovitch. And could you see if my brother is here,
and send him to me?
Well, have you found your brother?
Your brother is here,
Excuse me, I did not
know you, and, indeed, our acquaintance was so slight,
that no doubt you do not remember me.
Oh, no,
I should have known you because your mother and I
have been talking, I think, of nothing but you all the way.
And still no sign of my brother.
Do call him, Alexey,
Oblonsky! Here!
She’s very sweet, isn’t she?
Her husband put her with me, and I was delighted to have her. We’ve
been talking all the way. And so you, I hear ... _vous filez le parfait
amour. Tant mieux, mon cher, tant mieux._
I don’t know what you are referring to, maman,
Come, maman, let us go.
Well, countess, you have met your son, and I my brother,
And all my gossip is exhausted. I should have nothing more to tell
you.
Oh, no,
I could go all around
the world with you and never be dull. You are one of those delightful
women in whose company it’s sweet to be silent as well as to talk. Now
please don’t fret over your son; you can’t expect never to be parted.
Anna Arkadyevna,
has a
little son eight years old, I believe, and she has never been parted
from him before, and she keeps fretting over leaving him.
Yes, the countess and I have been talking all the time, I of my son
and she of hers,
I am afraid that you must have been dreadfully bored,
Thank you so much. The time has passed so quickly. Good-bye,
countess.
Good-bye, my love,
Let me have a kiss of your
pretty face. I speak plainly, at my age, and I tell you simply that
I’ve lost my heart to you.
Very charming,
Well, maman, are you perfectly well?
Everything has been delightful. Alexander has been very good, and
Marie has grown very pretty. She’s very interesting.
Here’s Lavrenty,
now we can
go, if you like.
Come; there’s not such a crowd now,
What?... What?... Where?... Flung himself!... Crushed!...
Ah, how awful! Ah, Anna, if you had seen it! Ah, how awful!
Oh, if you had seen it, countess,
And his
wife was there.... It was awful to see her!... She flung herself on the
body. They say he was the only support of an immense family. How
awful!
Couldn’t one do anything for her?
I’ll be back directly, maman,
Now let us be off,
You gave my assistant two hundred roubles. Would you kindly explain
for whose benefit you intend them?
For the widow,
I should have
thought there was no need to ask.
You gave that?
Very nice, very nice! Isn’t he a splendid fellow?
Good-bye, countess.
What a horrible death!
They say he was
cut in two pieces.
On the contrary, I think it’s the easiest—instantaneous,
How is it they don’t take proper precautions?
What is it, Anna?
It’s an omen of evil,
What nonsense!
You’ve come, that’s the
chief thing. You can’t conceive how I’m resting my hopes on you.
Have you known Vronsky long?
Yes. You know we’re hoping he will marry Kitty.
Yes?
Come now, let us talk of you,
Let us talk of your affairs. I got your
letter, and here I am.
Yes, all my hopes are in you,
Well, tell me all about it.
Keep your hands still, Grisha,
And, after all, Anna is in no wise to
blame,
I know nothing of her except the very best, and
I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards
myself.
But why should I not receive her? If only she doesn’t take it
into her head to console me!
All consolation and
counsel and Christian forgiveness, all that I have thought over a
thousand times, and it’s all no use.
What, here already!
Dolly, how glad I am to see you!
I am glad, too,
Most likely
she knows,
Well,
come along, I’ll take you to your room,
Is this Grisha? Heavens, how he’s grown!
No, please, let us stay here.
You are radiant with health and happiness!
I?... Yes,
Merciful heavens, Tanya! You’re the same age
as my Seryozha,
Delightful child, delightful!
Show me them all.
Very well, we will go to them,
It’s a pity Vassya’s
asleep.
Dolly,
he has told me.
Dolly, dear,
I don’t want to speak for him to you, nor to
try to comfort you; that’s impossible. But, darling, I’m simply sorry,
sorry from my heart for you!
To comfort me’s impossible. Everything’s lost after what has happened,
everything’s over!
But, Dolly, what’s to be done, what’s to be done? How is it best to
act in this awful position—that’s what you must think of.
All’s over, and there’s nothing more,
And the worst of
all is, you see, that I can’t cast him off: there are the children, I
am tied. And I can’t live with him! it’s a torture to me to see him.
Dolly, darling, he has spoken to me, but I want to hear it from you:
tell me about it.
Very well,
But I will tell you it from the
beginning. You know how I was married. With the education mamma gave us
I was more than innocent, I was stupid. I knew nothing. I know they say
men tell their wives of their former lives, but Stiva
Stepan Arkadyevitch told me nothing. You’ll hardly believe it,
but till now I imagined that I was the only woman he had known. So I
lived eight years. You must understand that I was so far from
suspecting infidelity, I regarded it as impossible, and then—try to
imagine it—with such ideas, to find out suddenly all the horror, all
the loathsomeness.... You must try and understand me. To be fully
convinced of one’s happiness, and all at once....
to get a letter ... his letter to his mistress,
my governess. No, it’s too awful!
I can understand being carried
away by feeling,
but deliberately,
slyly deceiving me ... and with whom?... To go on being my husband
together with her ... it’s awful! You can’t understand....
Oh, yes, I understand! I understand! Dolly, dearest, I do understand,
And do you imagine he realizes all the awfulness of my position?
Not the slightest! He’s happy and contented.
Oh, no!
He’s to be pitied, he’s weighed
down by remorse....
Is he capable of remorse?
Yes. I know him. I could not look at him without feeling sorry for
him. We both know him. He’s good-hearted, but he’s proud, and now he’s
so humiliated. What touched me most....
he’s tortured by two things: that he’s ashamed
for the children’s sake, and that, loving you—yes, yes, loving you
beyond everything on earth,
he has hurt you, pierced you to the heart. ‘No, no, she
cannot forgive me,’ he keeps saying.
Yes, I can see that his position is awful; it’s worse for the guilty
than the innocent,
if he feels that all the misery comes
from his fault. But how am I to forgive him, how am I to be his wife
again after her? For me to live with him now would be torture, just
because I love my past love for him....
She’s young, you see, she’s pretty,
Do you know, Anna,
my youth and my beauty are gone, taken by whom? By him and his
children. I have worked for him, and all I had has gone in his service,
and now of course any fresh, vulgar creature has more charm for him. No
doubt they talked of me together, or, worse still, they were silent. Do
you understand?
And after that he will tell me.... What! can I believe him? Never! No,
everything is over, everything that once made my comfort, the reward of
my work, and my sufferings.... Would you believe it, I was teaching
Grisha just now: once this was a joy to me, now it is a torture. What
have I to strive and toil for? Why are the children here? What’s so
awful is that all at once my heart’s turned, and instead of love and
tenderness, I have nothing but hatred for him; yes, hatred. I could
kill him.
Darling Dolly, I understand, but don’t torture yourself. You are so
distressed, so overwrought, that you look at many things mistakenly.
What’s to be done? Think for me, Anna, help me. I have thought over
everything, and I see nothing.
One thing I would say,
I am his sister, I know his
character, that faculty of forgetting everything, everything
that faculty for being completely
carried away, but for completely repenting too. He cannot believe it,
he cannot comprehend now how he can have acted as he did.
No; he understands, he understood!
But I ... you are
forgetting me ... does it make it easier for me?
Wait a minute. When he told me, I will own I did not realize all the
awfulness of your position. I saw nothing but him, and that the family
was broken up. I felt sorry for him, but after talking to you, I see
it, as a woman, quite differently. I see your agony, and I can’t tell
you how sorry I am for you! But, Dolly, darling, I fully realize your
sufferings, only there is one thing I don’t know; I don’t know ... I
don’t know how much love there is still in your heart for him. That you
know—whether there is enough for you to be able to forgive him. If
there is, forgive him!
No,
I know more of the world than you do,
I know how men like
Stiva look at it. You speak of his talking of you with her. That never
happened. Such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred
to them. Somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt
by them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family. They draw
a sort of line that can’t be crossed between them and their families. I
don’t understand it, but it is so.
Yes, but he has kissed her....
Dolly, hush, darling. I saw Stiva when he was in love with you. I
remember the time when he came to me and cried, talking of you, and all
the poetry and loftiness of his feeling for you, and I know that the
longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes. You
know we have sometimes laughed at him for putting in at every word:
‘Dolly’s a marvelous woman.’ You have always been a divinity for him,
and you are that still, and this has not been an infidelity of the
heart....
But if it is repeated?
It cannot be, as I understand it....
Yes, but could you forgive it?
I don’t know, I can’t judge.... Yes, I can,
Yes, I can, I can, I can. Yes, I could
forgive it. I could not be the same, no; but I could forgive it, and
forgive it as though it had never been, never been at all....
Oh, of course,
else it would not be forgiveness. If one
forgives, it must be completely, completely. Come, let us go; I’ll take
you to your room,
My dear, how glad I am you came. It has made things better, ever
so much better.
Come, God is merciful,
Stiva,
Stiva,
go, and God help you.
Come, come, as we were sitting before,
And when is your next ball?
Next week, and a splendid ball. One of those balls where one always
enjoys oneself.
Why, are there balls where one always enjoys oneself?
It’s strange, but there are. At the Bobrishtchevs’ one always enjoys
oneself, and at the Nikitins’ too, while at the Mezhkovs’ it’s always
dull. Haven’t you noticed it?
No, my dear, for me there are no balls now where one enjoys oneself,
For me there are some less dull and tiresome.
How can _you_ be dull at a ball?
Why should not _I_ be dull at a ball?
Because you always look nicer than anyone.
In the first place it’s never so; and secondly, if it were, what
difference would it make to me?
Are you coming to this ball?
I imagine it won’t be possible to avoid going. Here, take it,
I shall be so glad if you go. I should so like to see you at a ball.
Anyway, if I do go, I shall comfort myself with the thought that it’s
a pleasure to you ... Grisha, don’t pull my hair. It’s untidy enough
without that,
I imagine you at the ball in lilac.
And why in lilac precisely?
Now, children, run
along, run along. Do you hear? Miss Hoole is calling you to tea,
I know why you press me to come to the ball. You expect a great deal
of this ball, and you want everyone to be there to take part in it.
How do you know? Yes.
Oh! what a happy time you are at,
I remember, and I
know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland. That
mist which covers everything in that blissful time when childhood is
just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a
path growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming
to enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... Who has not
been through it?
But how did she go through it? How I
should like to know all her love story!
I know something. Stiva told me, and I congratulate you. I liked him
so much,
I met Vronsky at the railway station.
Oh, was he there?
What was it Stiva told
you?
Stiva gossiped about it all. And I should be so glad ... I traveled
yesterday with Vronsky’s mother,
and his mother talked
without a pause of him, he’s her favorite. I know mothers are partial,
but....
What did his mother tell you?
Oh, a great deal! And I know that he’s her favorite; still one can see
how chivalrous he is.... Well, for instance, she told me that he had
wanted to give up all his property to his brother, that he had done
something extraordinary when he was quite a child, saved a woman out of
the water. He’s a hero, in fact,
She pressed me very much to go and see her,
and I
shall be glad to go to see her tomorrow. Stiva is staying a long while
in Dolly’s room, thank God,
No, I’m first! No, I!
All together,
I am afraid you’ll be cold upstairs,
I want to move you downstairs, and we shall be nearer.
Oh, please, don’t trouble about me,
It will be lighter for you here,
I assure you that I sleep everywhere, and always like a marmot.
What’s the question?
I want to move Anna downstairs, but we must hang up blinds. No one
knows how to do it; I must see to it myself,
God knows whether they are fully reconciled,
Oh, nonsense, Dolly, always making difficulties,
Come, I’ll do it all, if you like....
Yes, they must be reconciled,
I know how you do everything,
You tell Matvey to do
what can’t be done, and go away yourself, leaving him to make a muddle
of everything,
Full, full reconciliation, full,
thank God!
Not at all. Why do you always look down on me and Matvey?
She is in my album,
and, by the way, I’ll show you my
Seryozha,
Who can that be?
It’s early for me to be fetched, and for anyone else it’s late,
Sure to be someone with papers for me,
And nothing would induce him to come up. What a queer fellow he is!
He has been at home,
and didn’t find me, and thought I should be here, but he did
not come up because he thought it late, and Anna’s here.
young bucks,
How nice you’ve come in good time,
such a bad habit to be late.
It’s a rest to waltz with you,
It’s exquisite—such lightness,
precision.
Another turn, eh? You’re not tired?
No, thank you!
Where shall I take you?
Madame Karenina’s here, I think ... take me to her.
Wherever you command.
Pardon, mesdames,
pardon, pardon, mesdames
No, I don’t throw stones,
though I can’t understand it,
You came into the room
dancing,
This is one of my most faithful supporters,
The princess helps to make
balls happy and successful. Anna Arkadyevna, a waltz?
Why, have you met?
Is there anyone we have not met? My wife and I are like white
wolves—everyone knows us,
A waltz, Anna
Arkadyevna?
I don’t dance when it’s possible not to dance,
But tonight it’s impossible,
Well, since it’s impossible tonight, let us start,
What is she vexed with him about?
_Pardon! pardon!_ Waltz! waltz!
Who?
All or one?
No, it’s not the
admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her, but the adoration of one.
And that one? can it be he?
But what of him?
I would not offend you,
but I want to save myself, and I don’t know how.
But perhaps I am wrong, perhaps it was not so?
Kitty, what is it?
I don’t understand it.
Kitty, you’re not dancing the mazurka?
No, no,
He asked her for the mazurka before me,
he
her.
She said:
‘Why, aren’t you going to dance it with Princess Shtcherbatskaya?’
Oh, I don’t care!
Delightful ball!
Yes,
Yes, there is something uncanny, devilish and fascinating in her,
Nonsense, Anna Arkadyevna,
I’ve such an idea for a _cotillion! Un
bijou!_
No, I am not going to stay,
No; why, as it is, I have danced more at your ball in Moscow than I
have all the winter in Petersburg,
I must rest a little before my journey.
Are you certainly going tomorrow then?
Yes, I suppose so,
Yes, there is something in me hateful, repulsive,
And I don’t get on with other people. Pride,
they say. No, I have no pride. If I had any pride, I should not have
put myself in such a position.
Yes, she was
bound to choose him. So it had to be, and I cannot complain of anyone
or anything. I am myself to blame. What right had I to imagine she
would care to join her life to mine? Who am I and what am I? A nobody,
not wanted by anyone, nor of use to anybody.
Isn’t
he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome? And are we
fair in our judgment of brother Nikolay? Of course, from the point of
view of Prokofy, seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy, he’s a
despicable person. But I know him differently. I know his soul, and
know that we are like him. And I, instead of going to seek him out,
went out to dinner, and came here.
I will tell him
everything, without reserve, and I will make him speak without reserve,
too, and I’ll show him that I love him, and so understand him,
At the top, 12 and 13,
At home?
Sure to be at home.
It all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing’s done.
Well, the devil flay them, the privileged classes,
Masha! get us some supper and some wine
if there’s any left; or else go and get some.
There’s some gentleman, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,
Whom do you want?
It’s I,
Who’s _I_?
Ah, Kostya!
I wrote to you and Sergey Ivanovitch both that I don’t know you and
don’t want to know you. What is it you want?
I didn’t want to see you for anything,
I’ve
simply come to see you.
Oh, so that’s it?
Well, come in; sit down. Like some
supper? Masha, bring supper for three. No, stop a minute. Do you know
who this is?
This is Mr. Kritsky, my friend from Kiev, a
very remarkable man. He’s persecuted by the police, of course, because
he’s not a scoundrel.
Wait a minute, I said.
You’re of the Kiev university?
Yes, I was of Kiev,
And this woman,
is
the partner of my life, Marya Nikolaevna. I took her out of a bad
house,
but I love her and respect
her, and anyone who wants to know me,
I beg to love her and respect her. She’s just the
same as my wife, just the same. So now you know whom you’ve to do with.
And if you think you’re lowering yourself, well, here’s the floor,
there’s the door.
Why I should be lowering myself, I don’t understand.
Then, Masha, tell them to bring supper; three portions, spirits and
wine.... No, wait a minute.... No, it doesn’t matter.... Go along.
So you see,
Here, do you see?
Do you see that?
That’s the beginning of a new thing we’re going into. It’s a productive
association....
You know that capital oppresses the laborer. The laborers with us, the
peasants, bear all the burden of labor, and are so placed that however
much they work they can’t escape from their position of beasts of
burden. All the profits of labor, on which they might improve their
position, and gain leisure for themselves, and after that education,
all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists. And
society’s so constituted that the harder they work, the greater the
profit of the merchants and landowners, while they stay beasts of
burden to the end. And that state of things must be changed,
Yes, of course,
And so we’re founding a locksmiths’ association, where all the
production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be
in common.
Where is the association to be?
In the village of Vozdrem, Kazan government.
But why in a village? In the villages, I think, there is plenty of
work as it is. Why a locksmiths’ association in a village?
Why? Because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were,
and that’s why you and Sergey Ivanovitch don’t like people to try and
get them out of their slavery,
I know your and Sergey Ivanovitch’s aristocratic views. I know that he
applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils.
No; and what do you talk of Sergey Ivanovitch for?
Sergey Ivanovitch? I’ll tell you what for!
I’ll tell you what for....
But what’s the use of talking? There’s only one thing.... What did you
come to me for? You look down on this, and you’re welcome to,—and go
away, in God’s name go away!
And go away, and go away!
I don’t look down on it at all,
I
don’t even dispute it.
I’m not well; I’ve grown irritable,
and then you talk to me of Sergey
Ivanovitch and his article. It’s such rubbish, such lying, such
self-deception. What can a man write of justice who knows nothing of
it? Have you read his article?
I’ve not read it,
Why not?
Because I didn’t see the use of wasting my time over it.
Oh, but excuse me, how did you know it would be wasting your time?
That article’s too deep for many people—that’s to say it’s over their
heads. But with me, it’s another thing; I see through his ideas, and I
know where its weakness lies.
Won’t you have supper? All right, good-bye! Come round tomorrow with
the locksmith.
He’s no good either,
I see, of course....
What do you want now?
Have you been long with my brother?
Yes, more than a year. Nikolay Dmitrievitch’s health has become very
poor. Nikolay Dmitrievitch drinks a great deal,
That is ... how does he drink?
Drinks vodka, and it’s bad for him.
And a great deal?
Yes,
What were you talking about?
What was it?
Oh, nothing,
Oh, if you don’t want to say, don’t. Only it’s no good your talking to
her. She’s a wench, and you’re a gentleman,
You understand everything, I see, and have taken stock of
everything, and look with commiseration on my shortcomings,
Nikolay Dmitrievitch, Nikolay Dmitrievitch,
Oh, very well, very well!... But where’s the supper? Ah, here it is,
Here, set it here,
Like a drink?
Well, enough of Sergey Ivanovitch. I’m glad to see you, anyway. After
all’s said and done, we’re not strangers. Come, have a drink. Tell me
what you’re doing,
How are you living?
I live alone in the country, as I used to. I’m busy looking after the
land,
Why don’t you get married?
It hasn’t happened so,
Why not? For me now ... everything’s at an end! I’ve made a mess of my
life. But this I’ve said, and I say still, that if my share had been
given me when I needed it, my whole life would have been different.
Do you know your little Vanya’s with me, a clerk in the countinghouse
at Pokrovskoe.
Yes, tell me what’s going on at Pokrovskoe. Is the house standing
still, and the birch trees, and our schoolroom? And Philip the
gardener, is he living? How I remember the arbor and the seat! Now mind
and don’t alter anything in the house, but make haste and get married,
and make everything as it used to be again. Then I’ll come and see you,
if your wife is nice.
But come to me now,
How nicely we would arrange it!
I’d come and see you if I were sure I should not find Sergey
Ivanovitch.
You wouldn’t find him there. I live quite independently of him.
Yes, but say what you like, you will have to choose between me and
him,
If you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject, I tell you
that in your quarrel with Sergey Ivanovitch I take neither side. You’re
both wrong. You’re more wrong externally, and he inwardly.
Ah, ah! You see that, you see that!
But I personally value friendly relations with you more because....
Why, why?
Enough, Nikolay Dmitrievitch!
Let it be! Don’t insist! I’ll beat you!
And do you suppose she understands nothing?
She
understands it all better than any of us. Isn’t it true there’s
something good and sweet in her?
Were you never before in Moscow?
Only you mustn’t be polite and stiff with her. It frightens her. No
one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her
for trying to get out of a house of ill-fame. Mercy on us, the
senselessness in the world!
These new
institutions, these justices of the peace, rural councils, what
hideousness it all is!
In another world we shall understand it all,
In another world! Ah, I don’t like that other world! I don’t like it,
Here one
would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess, one’s own
and other people’s, would be a good thing, and yet I’m afraid of death,
awfully afraid of death.
But do drink something. Would
you like some champagne? Or shall we go somewhere? Let’s go to the
Gypsies! Do you know I have got so fond of the Gypsies and Russian
songs.
You’re soon back again, sir,
I got tired of it, Agafea Mihalovna. With friends, one is well; but at
home, one is better,
No,
you’re not going to get away from us, and you’re not going to be
different, but you’re going to be the same as you’ve always been; with
doubts, everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself, vain efforts to
amend, and falls, and everlasting expectation, of a happiness which you
won’t get, and which isn’t possible for you.
Kouzma, give me my sheepskin. And you tell them to take a lantern.
I’ll come and look at her,
Here, bring the light, Fyodor, this way,
Like the mother! though the color takes after the father; but
that’s nothing. Very good. Long and broad in the haunch. Vassily
Fedorovitch, isn’t she splendid?
How could she fail to be? Oh, Semyon the contractor came the day after
you left. You must settle with him, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
I did inform you about the machine.
Well, I’ll stay a
while, sir,
In two years’ time I shall have two Dutch cows; Pava
herself will perhaps still be alive, a dozen young daughters of Berkoot
and the three others—how lovely!
Very good, electricity and heat are the
same thing; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the
other in the equation for the solution of any problem? No. Well, then
what of it? The connection between all the forces of nature is felt
instinctively.... It’s particulary nice if Pava’s daughter should be a
red-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other
three, too! Splendid! To go out with my wife and visitors to meet the
herd.... My wife says, ‘Kostya and I looked after that calf like a
child.’ ‘How can it interest you so much?’ says a visitor. ‘Everything
that interests him, interests me.’ But who will she be?
Well, there’s nothing to be
done.... It’s not my fault. But now everything shall go on in a new
way. It’s nonsense to pretend that life won’t let one, that the past
won’t let one. One must struggle to live better, much better.
There, who’d have thought it?
The dog now ...
why, she understands that her master’s come home, and that he’s
low-spirited.
Why low-spirited?
Do you suppose I don’t see it, sir? It’s high time I should know the
gentry. Why, I’ve grown up from a little thing with them. It’s nothing,
sir, so long as there’s health and a clear conscience.
Shall I fetch you another cup?
That’s what I’ll do,
that’s what I’ll do!
Nothing’s amiss.... All’s well.
No, I must go, I must go
no, it had really
better be today!
How queer you are today!
I? Do you think so? I’m not queer, but I’m nasty. I am like that
sometimes. I keep feeling as if I could cry. It’s very stupid, but
it’ll pass off,
In the same way I didn’t want to leave
Petersburg, and now I don’t want to go away from here.
You came here and did a good deed,
Don’t say that, Dolly. I’ve done nothing, and could do nothing. I
often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me. What have I
done, and what could I do? In your heart there was found love enough to
forgive....
If it had not been for you, God knows what would have happened! How
happy you are, Anna!
Everything is clear and good in your
heart.
Every heart has its own _skeletons_, as the English say.
You have no sort of _skeleton_, have you? Everything is so clear in
you.
I have!
Come, he’s amusing, anyway, your _skeleton_, and not depressing,
No, he’s depressing. Do you know why I’m going today instead of
tomorrow? It’s a confession that weighs on me; I want to make it to
you,
Yes,
Do you know why Kitty didn’t come to dinner?
She’s jealous of me. I have spoiled ... I’ve been the cause of that
ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure. But truly, truly,
it’s not my fault, or only my fault a little bit,
a little bit.
Oh, how like Stiva you said that!
Oh no, oh no! I’m not Stiva,
That’s
why I’m telling you, just because I could never let myself doubt myself
for an instant,
Yes, Stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him, and that he....
You can’t imagine how absurdly it all came about. I only meant to be
matchmaking, and all at once it turned out quite differently. Possibly
against my own will....
Oh, they feel it directly?
But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his
side,
And I am certain it will all be
forgotten, and Kitty will leave off hating me.
All the same, Anna, to tell you the truth, I’m not very anxious for
this marriage for Kitty. And it’s better it should come to nothing, if
he, Vronsky, is capable of falling in love with you in a single day.
Oh, heavens, that would be too silly!
And so here I am going away, having made
an enemy of Kitty, whom I liked so much! Ah, how sweet she is! But
you’ll make it right, Dolly? Eh?
An enemy? That can’t be.
I did so want you all to care for me, as I do for you, and now I care
for you more than ever,
Ah, how
silly I am today!
Remember, Anna, what
you’ve done for me—I shall never forget. And remember that I love you,
and shall always love you as my dearest friend!
I don’t know why,
You understood me, and you understand. Good-bye, my darling!
Come, it’s all over, and thank God!
Thank God!
tomorrow I shall see Seryozha and Alexey Alexandrovitch, and my life
will go on in the old way, all nice and as usual.
What have I to be ashamed of?
Warm,
very warm, hot.
Well, what is it?
What does it mean? Am I afraid to
look it straight in the face? Why, what is it? Can it be that between
me and this officer boy there exist, or can exist, any other relations
than such as are common with every acquaintance?
What’s that on the arm of the chair, a fur cloak or some
beast? And what am I myself? Myself or some other woman?
Do you wish to get out?
Yes, I want a little air. It’s very hot in here.
Hand over that
telegram!
This way! No. 28!
I didn’t know you were going. What are you coming for?
What am I coming for?
You know that I have come to be where you are,
I can’t help
it.
Forgive me, if you dislike what I said,
It’s wrong, what you say, and I beg you, if you’re a good man, to
forget what you’ve said, as I forget it,
Not one word, not one gesture of yours shall I, could I, ever
forget....
Enough, enough!
Oh, mercy! why do
his ears look like that?
Yes, as you see, your tender spouse, as devoted as the first year
after marriage, burned with impatience to see you,
Is Seryozha quite well?
And is this all the reward,
for my ardor? He’s quite
well....
Once more,
once more I shall see her walk, her
face; she will say something, turn her head, glance, smile, maybe.
Ah, yes!
The husband.
No, she does not love him and cannot love him,
Have you passed a good night?
Thank you, very good,
Count Vronsky,
Ah! We are acquainted, I believe,
You set off with the mother and you return with the son,
You’re back from leave, I suppose?
Well, were a great
many tears shed at Moscow at parting?
I hope I may have the honor of calling on you,
Delighted,
On Mondays we’re at home. Most
fortunate,
that I
should just have half an hour to meet you, so that I can prove my
devotion,
You lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much,
But what has it to do with me?
Oh, capitally! Mariette says he has been very good, And ... I must
disappoint you ... but he has not missed you as your husband has. But
once more _merci,_ my dear, for giving me a day. Our dear _Samovar_
will be delighted.
She has been continually asking after you. And, do you
know, if I may venture to advise you, you should go and see her today.
You know how she takes everything to heart. Just now, with all her own
cares, she’s anxious about the Oblonskys being brought together.
But you know I wrote to her?
Still she’ll want to hear details. Go and see her, if you’re not too
tired, my dear. Well, Kondraty will take you in the carriage, while I
go to my committee. I shall not be alone at dinner again,
You wouldn’t
believe how I’ve missed....
Mother! mother!
I told you it was mother!
I knew!
Why, am I not so nice as she?
To me you’re nicer than anyone in the world.
I know that,
Well, my dear, so you took the olive branch?
Yes, it’s all over, but it was all much less serious than we had
supposed,
My _belle-sœur_ is in general too hasty.
Yes, there’s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world. I am so worried
today.
Oh, why?
I’m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth, and
sometimes I’m quite unhinged by it. The Society of the Little Sisters
was
going splendidly, but with these gentlemen it’s impossible to do
anything,
They pounce on the idea, and distort it, and
then work it out so pettily and unworthily. Two or three people, your
husband among them, understand all the importance of the thing, but the
others simply drag it down. Yesterday Pravdin wrote to me....
It was all the same before, of course; but why was it I didn’t notice
it before?
Or has she been very much irritated
today? It’s really ludicrous; her object is doing good; she a
Christian, yet she’s always angry; and she always has enemies, and
always enemies in the name of Christianity and doing good.
What
was it? Nothing. Vronsky said something silly, which it was easy to put
a stop to, and I answered as I ought to have done. To speak of it to my
husband would be unnecessary and out of the question. To speak of it
would be to attach importance to what has no importance.
So then there’s no reason to speak of it? And
indeed, thank God, there’s nothing to speak of,
Unhasting and unresting,
Yes, my solitude is over. You wouldn’t believe how uncomfortable
it is to dine alone.
Here you are at last!
Altogether then, I see your visit was a success,
Oh, yes,
I imagine one cannot exonerate such a man from blame, though he is
your brother,
I am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily, and that you are back
again,
Come, what do they say about the new act I have
got passed in the council?
Here, on the other hand, it has made a great sensation,
I was very, very glad. It shows that at last a reasonable and steady
view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us.
And you’ve not been anywhere this evening? You’ve been dull, I
expect?
Oh, no!
What are you reading now?
Just now I’m reading Duc de Lille, _Poésie des Enfers,_
A very remarkable book.
Well, God be with you,
And I’ll write to Moscow.
All the same he’s a good man; truthful, good-hearted, and remarkable
in his own line,
But why is it his ears stick out so
strangely? Or has he had his hair cut?
It’s time, it’s time,
And what right had he to look at him like that?
If that’s one of the villains, don’t let him in!
Bravo! Vronsky!
Our host himself! Baroness, some coffee for him out of the new coffee
pot. Why, we didn’t expect you! Hope you’re satisfied with the ornament
of your study,
You know each other,
of course?
I should think so,
What next! I’m an old friend.
You’re home after a journey,
so I’m flying. Oh,
I’ll be off this minute, if I’m in the way.
You’re home, wherever you are, baroness,
How do you
do, Kamerovsky?
There, you never know how to say such pretty things,
No; what’s that for? After dinner I say things quite as good.
After dinner there’s no credit in them? Well, then, I’ll make you some
coffee, so go and wash and get ready,
Pierre,
give me the coffee,
I’ll put it in.
You’ll spoil it!
No, I won’t spoil it! Well, and your wife?
We’ve
been marrying you here. Have you brought your wife?
No, baroness. I was born a Bohemian, and a Bohemian I shall die.
So much the better, so much the better. Shake hands on it.
He persists in refusing to give me a divorce! Well, what am I to do?
Now I want to begin a suit against him. What
do you advise? Kamerovsky, look after the coffee; it’s boiling over.
You see, I’m engrossed with business! I want a lawsuit, because I must
have my property. Do you understand the folly of it, that on the
pretext of my being unfaithful to him,
he
wants to get the benefit of my fortune.
Well now, good-bye, or you’ll never get washed, and I shall have on my
conscience the worst sin a gentleman can commit. So you would advise a
knife to his throat?
To be sure, and manage that your hand may not be far from his lips.
He’ll kiss your hand, and all will end satisfactorily,
So at the Français!
genre of the slave Rebecca, don’t you know.
Impossible!
Impossible!
And is he as stupid and pleased as ever? Well, and how’s
Buzulukov?
Oh, there is a tale about Buzulukov—simply lovely!
You know his weakness for balls, and he never misses a single court
ball. He went to a big ball in a new helmet. Have you seen the new
helmets? Very nice, lighter. Well, so he’s standing.... No, I say, do
listen.
I am listening,
Up comes the Grand Duchess with some ambassador or other, and, as
ill-luck would have it, she begins talking to him about the new
helmets. The Grand Duchess positively wanted to show the new helmet to
the ambassador. They see our friend standing there.
The Grand Duchess asked
him to give her the helmet; he doesn’t give it to her. What do you
think of that? Well, everyone’s winking at him, nodding, frowning—give
it to her, do! He doesn’t give it to her. He’s mute as a fish. Only
picture it!... Well, the ... what’s his name, whatever he was ... tries
to take the helmet from him ... he won’t give it up!... He pulls it
from him, and hands it to the Grand Duchess. ‘Here, your Highness,’
says he, ‘is the new helmet.’ She turned the helmet the other side up,
And—just picture it!—plop went a pear and sweetmeats out of it, two
pounds of sweetmeats!... He’d been storing them up, the darling!
Conceited blockhead!
Well, doctor, decide our fate,
Tell me
everything.
Is there hope?
Well, doctor?
Immediately, princess. I will talk it over with my colleague, and then
I will have the honor of laying my opinion before you.
So we had better leave you?
As you please.
Yes,
But....
The commencement of the tuberculous process we are not, as you are
aware, able to define; till there are cavities, there is nothing
definite. But we may suspect it. And there are indications;
malnutrition, nervous excitability, and so on. The question stands
thus: in presence of indications of tuberculous process, what is to be
done to maintain nutrition?
But, you know, there are always moral, spiritual causes at the back in
these cases,
Yes, that’s an understood thing,
Beg pardon, is the Yausky bridge done
yet, or shall I have to drive around?
Ah! it is. Oh, well,
then I can do it in twenty minutes. So we were saying the problem may
be put thus: to maintain nutrition and to give tone to the nerves. The
one is in close connection with the other, one must attack both sides
at once.
And how about a tour abroad?
I’ve no liking for foreign tours. And take note: if there is an early
stage of tuberculous process, of which we cannot be certain, a foreign
tour will be of no use. What is wanted is means of improving nutrition,
and not for lowering it.
But in favor of foreign travel I would urge the change of habits, the
removal from conditions calling up reminiscences. And then the mother
wishes it,
Ah! Well, in that case, to be sure, let them go. Only, those German
quacks are mischievous.... They ought to be persuaded.... Well, let
them go then.
Oh! time’s up already,
What! another examination!
Oh, no, only a few details, princess.
Come this way.
May I trouble you to sit down, princess?
Excuse me, doctor, but there is really no object in this. This is the
third time you’ve asked me the same thing.
Nervous irritability,
However, I had finished....
Really, I’m quite well, mamma. But if you want to go abroad, let’s
go!
Well, well?
You’re all in good spirits. Good news, then?
Well, how are all of you?
Ah, mamma, we have plenty of troubles of our own. Lili is ill, and I’m
afraid it’s scarlatina. I have come here now to hear about Kitty, and
then I shall shut myself up entirely, if—God forbid—it should be
scarlatina.
How have you settled it? you’re going? Well, and what do you mean to
do with me?
I suppose you had better stay here, Alexander,
That’s as you like.
Mamma, why shouldn’t father come with us?
It would be
nicer for him and for us too.
These stupid chignons! There’s no getting at the real daughter. One
simply strokes the bristles of dead women. Well, Dolinka,
what’s your young buck about, hey?
Nothing, father,
He’s always out; I scarcely ever see him,
Why, hasn’t he gone into the country yet—to see about selling that
forest?
No, he’s still getting ready for the journey.
Oh, that’s it!
And so am I to be getting ready for
a journey too? At your service,
And I tell you what, Katia,
you
must wake up one fine day and say to yourself: Why, I’m quite well, and
merry, and going out again with father for an early morning walk in the
frost. Hey?
Yes, he sees it
all, he understands it all, and in these words he’s telling me that
though I’m ashamed, I must get over my shame.
See what comes of your jokes!
You’re always....
She’s so much to be pitied, poor child, so much to be pitied, and you
don’t feel how it hurts her to hear the slightest reference to the
cause of it. Ah! to be so mistaken in people!
I don’t know why there aren’t laws against such
base, dishonorable people.
Ah, I can’t bear to hear you!
There are laws, madam, and since you’ve challenged me to
it, I’ll tell you who’s to blame for it all: you and you, you and
nobody else. Laws against such young gallants there have always been,
and there still are! Yes, if there has been nothing that ought not to
have been, old as I am, I’d have called him out to the barrier, the
young dandy. Yes, and now you physic her and call in these quacks.
Alexander, Alexander,
There, that’s enough, that’s enough! You’re wretched too, I know. It
can’t be helped. There’s no great harm done. God is merciful ...
thanks....
I’d been meaning to tell you something for a long while, mamma: did
you know that Levin meant to make Kitty an offer when he was here the
last time? He told Stiva so.
Well, what then? I don’t understand....
So did Kitty perhaps refuse him?... She didn’t tell you so?
No, she has said nothing to me either of one or the other; she’s too
proud. But I know it’s all on account of the other.
Yes, but suppose she has refused Levin, and she wouldn’t have refused
him if it hadn’t been for the other, I know. And then, he has deceived
her so horribly.
Oh, I really don’t understand! Nowadays they will all go their own
way, and mothers haven’t a word to say in anything, and then....
Mamma, I’ll go up to her.
Well, do. Did I tell you not to?
I’m just going now, and I shall have to keep in and you won’t be able
to come to see me,
I want to
talk to you.
What about?
What should it be, but your trouble?
I have no trouble.
Nonsense, Kitty. Do you suppose I could help knowing? I know all about
it. And believe me, it’s of so little consequence.... We’ve all been
through it.
He’s not worth your grieving over him,
No, because he has treated me with contempt,
Don’t talk of it! Please, don’t talk of it!
But who can have told you so? No one has said that. I’m certain he was
in love with you, and would still be in love with you, if it
hadn’t....
Oh, the most awful thing of all for me is this sympathizing!
What, what is it you want to make me feel, eh?
That I’ve been in love with a man who didn’t care a straw for me, and
that I’m dying of love for him? And this is said to me by my own
sister, who imagines that ... that ... that she’s sympathizing with
me!... I don’t want these condolences and humbug!
Kitty, you’re unjust.
Why are you tormenting me?
But I ... quite the contrary ... I see you’re unhappy....
I’ve nothing to grieve over and be comforted about. I am too proud
ever to allow myself to care for a man who does not love me.
Yes, I don’t say so either.... Only one thing. Tell me the truth,
tell me, did Levin
speak to you?...
Why bring Levin in too? I can’t understand what you want to torment me
for. I’ve told you, and I say it again, that I have some pride, and
never, _never_ would I do as you’re doing—go back to a man who’s
deceived you, who has cared for another woman. I can’t understand it!
You may, but I can’t!
Dolinka, I am so, so wretched!
I have nothing to make me miserable,
but
can you understand that everything has become hateful, loathsome,
coarse to me, and I myself most of all? You can’t imagine what
loathsome thoughts I have about everything.
Why, whatever loathsome thoughts can you have?
The most utterly loathsome and coarse: I can’t tell you. It’s not
unhappiness, or low spirits, but much worse. As though everything that
was good in me was all hidden away, and nothing was left but the most
loathsome. Come, how am I to tell you?
Father began saying something to me just
now.... It seems to me he thinks all I want is to be married. Mother
takes me to a ball: it seems to me she only takes me to get me married
off as soon as may be, and be rid of me. I know it’s not the truth, but
I can’t drive away such thoughts. Eligible suitors, as they call them—I
can’t bear to see them. It seems to me they’re taking stock of me and
summing me up. In old days to go anywhere in a ball dress was a simple
joy to me, I admired myself; now I feel ashamed and awkward. And then!
The doctor.... Then....
Oh, well, everything presents itself to me, in the coarsest, most
loathsome light,
That’s my illness. Perhaps it will pass
off.
But you mustn’t think about it.
I can’t help it. I’m never happy except with the children at your
house.
What a pity you can’t be with me!
Oh, yes, I’m coming. I’ve had scarlatina, and I’ll persuade mamma to
let me.
the conscience of Petersburg society.
When I’m old and ugly I’ll be the same,
but for a
pretty young woman like you it’s early days for that house of charity.
Why didn’t you come to dinner?
I marvel at the
second sight of lovers,
_she wasn’t there_. But come after the opera.
But how I remember your jeers!
What’s become of all that? You’re caught, my dear boy.
That’s my one desire, to be caught,
If I complain of anything it’s only that
I’m not caught enough, to tell the truth. I begin to lose hope.
Why, whatever hope can you have?
_Entendons nous...._
None whatever,
Excuse me,
I’m afraid I’m becoming ridiculous.
But why was it you didn’t come to dinner?
I must tell you about that. I was busily employed, and doing what, do
you suppose? I’ll give you a hundred guesses, a thousand ... you’d
never guess. I’ve been reconciling a husband with a man who’d insulted
his wife. Yes, really!
Well, did you succeed?
Almost.
You really must tell me about it,
Come to me
in the next _entr’acte._
I can’t; I’m going to the French theater.
From Nilsson?
Can’t help it. I’ve an appointment there, all to do with my mission of
peace.
‘Blessed are the peacemakers; theirs is the kingdom of heaven,’
Very well, then, sit down, and tell me what it’s all about.
This is rather indiscreet, but it’s so good it’s an awful temptation
to tell the story,
I’m not going to mention any names.
But I shall guess, so much the better.
Well, listen: two festive young men were driving—
Officers of your regiment, of course?
I didn’t say they were officers,—two young men who had been lunching.
In other words, drinking.
Possibly. They were driving on their way to dinner with a friend in
the most festive state of mind. And they beheld a pretty woman in a
hired sledge; she overtakes them, looks round at them, and, so they
fancy anyway, nods to them and laughs. They, of course, follow her.
They gallop at full speed. To their amazement, the fair one alights at
the entrance of the very house to which they were going. The fair one
darts upstairs to the top story. They get a glimpse of red lips under a
short veil, and exquisite little feet.
You describe it with such feeling that I fancy you must be one of the
two.
And after what you said, just now! Well, the young men go in to their
comrade’s; he was giving a farewell dinner. There they certainly did
drink a little too much, as one always does at farewell dinners. And at
dinner they inquire who lives at the top in that house. No one knows;
only their host’s valet, in answer to their inquiry whether any ‘young
ladies’ are living on the top floor, answered that there were a great
many of them about there. After dinner the two young men go into their
host’s study, and write a letter to the unknown fair one. They compose
an ardent epistle, a declaration in fact, and they carry the letter
upstairs themselves, so as to elucidate whatever might appear not
perfectly intelligible in the letter.
Why are you telling me these horrible stories? Well?
They ring. A maid-servant opens the door, they hand her the letter,
and assure the maid that they’re both so in love that they’ll die on
the spot at the door. The maid, stupefied, carries in their messages.
All at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages, as red as
a lobster, announces that there is no one living in the flat except his
wife, and sends them both about their business.
How do you know he had whiskers like sausages, as you say?
Ah, you shall hear. I’ve just been to make peace between them.
Well, and what then?
That’s the most interesting part of the story. It appears that it’s a
happy couple, a government clerk and his lady. The government clerk
lodges a complaint, and I became a mediator, and such a mediator!... I
assure you Talleyrand couldn’t hold a candle to me.
Why, where was the difficulty?
Ah, you shall hear.... We apologize in due form: we are in despair, we
entreat forgiveness for the unfortunate misunderstanding. The
government clerk with the sausages begins to melt, but he, too, desires
to express his sentiments, and as soon as ever he begins to express
them, he begins to get hot and say nasty things, and again I’m obliged
to trot out all my diplomatic talents. I allowed that their conduct was
bad, but I urged him to take into consideration their heedlessness,
their youth; then, too, the young men had only just been lunching
together. ‘You understand. They regret it deeply, and beg you to
overlook their misbehavior.’ The government clerk was softened once
more. ‘I consent, count, and am ready to overlook it; but you perceive
that my wife—my wife’s a respectable woman—has been exposed to the
persecution, and insults, and effrontery of young upstarts,
scoundrels....’ And you must understand, the young upstarts are present
all the while, and I have to keep the peace between them. Again I call
out all my diplomacy, and again as soon as the thing was about at an
end, our friend the government clerk gets hot and red, and his sausages
stand on end with wrath, and once more I launch out into diplomatic
wiles.
Ah, he must tell you this story!
He has been making me laugh so.
Well, _bonne chance_!
Yes, it’s all very well,
Petritsky’s becoming impossible. Not a
week goes by without some scandal. This government clerk won’t let it
drop, he’ll go on with the thing.
It’s a disgraceful story, but killing. Kedrov really can’t fight the
gentleman! Was he so awfully hot?
But what do
you say to Claire today? She’s marvelous,
However often you see her, every day she’s
different. It’s only the French who can do that.
She’s exceptionally good as an actress; one can see she’s studied
Kaulbach,
Did you notice how she fell down?...
Oh, please, don’t let us talk about Nilsson! No one can possibly say
anything new about her,
Three people have
used that very phrase about Kaulbach to me today already, just as
though they had made a compact about it. And I can’t see why they liked
that remark so.
Do tell me something amusing but not spiteful,
They say that that’s a difficult task, that nothing’s amusing that
isn’t spiteful,
But I’ll try. Get me a
subject. It all lies in the subject. If a subject’s given me, it’s easy
to spin something round it. I often think that the celebrated talkers
of the last century would have found it difficult to talk cleverly now.
Everything clever is so stale....
That has been said long ago,
Don’t you think there’s something Louis Quinze about Tushkevitch?
Oh, yes! He’s in the same style as the drawing-room and that’s why it
is he’s so often here.
Have you heard the Maltishtcheva woman—the mother, not the
daughter—has ordered a costume in _diable rose_ color?
Nonsense! No, that’s too lovely!
I wonder that with her sense—for she’s not a fool, you know—that she
doesn’t see how funny she is.
How did you like Nilsson?
Oh, how can you steal upon anyone like that! How you startled me!
Please don’t talk to me about the opera; you know nothing
about music. I’d better meet you on your own ground, and talk about
your majolica and engravings. Come now, what treasure have you been
buying lately at the old curiosity shops?
Would you like me to show you? But you don’t understand such things.
Oh, do show me! I’ve been learning about them at those—what’s their
names?... the bankers ... they’ve some splendid engravings. They showed
them to us.
Why, have you been at the Schützburgs?
Yes, _ma chère_. They asked my husband and me to dinner, and told us
the sauce at that dinner cost a hundred pounds,
and very nasty
sauce it was, some green mess. We had to ask them, and I made them
sauce for eighteen pence, and everybody was very much pleased with it.
I can’t run to hundred-pound sauces.
She’s unique!
Marvelous!
Will you really not have tea? You should come over here by us.
No, we’re very happy here,
Anna is quite changed since her stay in Moscow. There’s something
strange about her,
The great change is that she brought back with her the shadow of
Alexey Vronsky,
Well, what of it? There’s a fable of Grimm’s about a man without a
shadow, a man who’s lost his shadow. And that’s his punishment for
something. I never could understand how it was a punishment. But a
woman must dislike being without a shadow.
Yes, but women with a shadow usually come to a bad end,
Bad luck to your tongue!
Madame
Karenina’s a splendid woman. I don’t like her husband, but I like her
very much.
Why don’t you like her husband? He’s such a remarkable man,
My husband says there are few statesmen like him in
Europe.
And my husband tells me just the same, but I don’t believe it,
If our husbands didn’t talk to us, we should see the
facts as they are. Alexey Alexandrovitch, to my thinking, is simply a
fool. I say it in a whisper ... but doesn’t it really make everything
clear? Before, when I was told to consider him clever, I kept looking
for his ability, and thought myself a fool for not seeing it; but
directly I said, _he’s a fool,_ though only in a whisper, everything’s
explained, isn’t it?
How spiteful you are today!
Not a bit. I’d no other way out of it. One of the two had to be a
fool. And, well, you know one can’t say that of oneself.
‘No one is satisfied with his fortune, and everyone is satisfied with
his wit.’
That’s just it, just it,
But the
point is that I won’t abandon Anna to your mercies. She’s so nice, so
charming. How can she help it if they’re all in love with her, and
follow her about like shadows?
Oh, I had no idea of blaming her for it,
If no one follows us about like a shadow, that’s no proof that we’ve
any right to blame her.
What wicked gossip were you talking over there?
About the Karenins. The princess gave us a sketch of Alexey
Alexandrovitch,
Pity we didn’t hear it!
Ah, here you are at last!
Where do I come from?
Well, there’s no help for it, I must confess. From
the _opera bouffe_. I do believe I’ve seen it a hundred times, and
always with fresh enjoyment. It’s exquisite! I know it’s disgraceful,
but I go to sleep at the opera, and I sit out the _opera bouffe_ to the
last minute, and enjoy it. This evening....
Please don’t tell us about that horror.
All right, I won’t especially as everyone knows those horrors.
And we should all go to see them if it were accepted as the correct
thing, like the opera,
I have been at Countess Lidia’s, and meant to have come here earlier,
but I stayed on. Sir John was there. He’s very interesting.
Oh, that’s this missionary?
Yes; he told us about the life in India, most interesting things.
Sir John! Yes, Sir John; I’ve seen him. He speaks well. The Vlassieva
girl’s quite in love with him.
And is it true the younger Vlassieva girl’s to marry Topov?
Yes, they say it’s quite a settled thing.
I wonder at the parents! They say it’s a marriage for love.
For love? What antediluvian notions you have! Can one talk of love in
these days?
What’s to be done? It’s a foolish old fashion that’s kept up still,
So much the worse for those who keep up the fashion. The only happy
marriages I know are marriages of prudence.
Yes, but then how often the happiness of these prudent marriages flies
away like dust just because that passion turns up that they have
refused to recognize,
But by marriages of prudence we mean those in which both parties have
sown their wild oats already. That’s like scarlatina—one has to go
through it and get it over.
Then they ought to find out how to vaccinate for love, like smallpox.
I was in love in my young days with a deacon,
I don’t know that it did me any good.
No; I imagine, joking apart, that to know love, one must make mistakes
and then correct them,
Even after marriage?
‘It’s never too late to mend.’
Just so,
one must make mistakes and correct them. What
do you think about it?
I think,
I
think ... of so many men, so many minds, certainly so many hearts, so
many kinds of love.
Oh, I have had a letter from Moscow. They write me that Kitty
Shtcherbatskaya’s very ill.
Really?
That doesn’t interest you?
On the contrary, it does, very much. What was it exactly they told
you, if I may know?
Give me a cup of tea,
What is it they write to you?
I often think men have no understanding of what’s not honorable though
they’re always talking of it,
I’ve
wanted to tell you so a long while,
I don’t quite understand the meaning of your words,
Yes, I have been wanting to tell you,
You behaved wrongly, very wrongly.
Do you suppose I don’t know that I’ve acted wrongly? But who was the
cause of my doing so?
What do you say that to me for?
You know what for,
That only shows you have no heart,
What you spoke of just now was a mistake, and not love.
Remember that I have forbidden you to utter that word, that hateful
word,
forbidden
I have long meant to tell you this,
I’ve come on purpose this evening, knowing I should meet
you. I have come to tell you that this must end. I have never blushed
before anyone, and you force me to feel to blame for something.
What do you wish of me?
I want you to go to Moscow and ask for Kitty’s forgiveness,
You don’t wish that?
If you love me, as you say,
do so that I may be at
peace.
Don’t you know that you’re all my life to me? But I know no peace, and
I can’t give it to you; all myself—and love ... yes. I can’t think of
you and myself apart. You and I are one to me. And I see no chance
before us of peace for me or for you. I see a chance of despair, of
wretchedness ... or I see a chance of bliss, what bliss!... Can it be
there’s no chance of it?
It’s come!
When I was beginning to despair,
and it seemed there would be no end—it’s come! She loves me! She owns
it!
Then do this for me: never say such things to me, and let us be
friends,
Friends we shall never be, you know that yourself. Whether we shall be
the happiest or the wretchedest of people—that’s in your hands.
I ask one thing only: I ask for the right to hope, to suffer as I do.
But if even that cannot be, command me to disappear, and I disappear.
You shall not see me if my presence is distasteful to you.
I don’t want to drive you away.
Only don’t change anything, leave everything as it is,
Here’s your husband.
Your Rambouillet is in full conclave,
the graces and the muses.
sneering,
This is getting indecorous,
What did I tell you?
I’m always amazed at the clearness and precision of your husband’s
language,
The most transcendental ideas seem to be within
my grasp when he’s speaking.
Oh, yes!
You’ve said nothing, of course, and I ask nothing,
but you know that friendship’s not what I want: that there’s only one
happiness in life for me, that word that you dislike so ... yes,
love!...
Love,
Why I don’t like the
word is that it means too much to me, far more than you can
understand,
_Au revoir!_
Yes, this I must decide and put a stop to; I must
express my view of it and my decision.
But
express what—what decision?
But after all,
what has occurred? Nothing. She was talking a long
while with him. But what of that? Surely women in society can talk to
whom they please. And then, jealousy means lowering both myself and
her,
Yes, I
must decide and put a stop to it, and express my view of it....
Decide how?
What had occurred?
Nothing,
And the worst of it all,
is that just now, at the very
moment when my great work is approaching completion
when I stand in
need of all my mental peace and all my energies, just now this stupid
worry should fall foul of me. But what’s to be done? I’m not one of
those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force
of character to face them.

“I must think it over, come to a decision, and put it out of my mind,
The question of her feelings, of what has passed and may be passing in
her soul, that’s not my affair; that’s the affair of her conscience,
and falls under the head of religion,
And so,
questions as to her
feelings, and so on, are questions for her conscience, with which I can
have nothing to do. My duty is clearly defined. As the head of the
family, I am a person bound in duty to guide her, and consequently, in
part the person responsible; I am bound to point out the danger I
perceive, to warn her, even to use my authority. I ought to speak
plainly to her.
I must say and express fully the following points: first, exposition
of the value to be attached to public opinion and to decorum; secondly,
exposition of religious significance of marriage; thirdly, if need be,
reference to the calamity possibly ensuing to our son; fourthly,
reference to the unhappiness likely to result to herself.
You’re not in bed? What a wonder!
It’s late,
Alexey Alexandrovitch,
Anna, it’s necessary for me to have a talk with you.
With me?
Why, what is it? What about?
Well, let’s talk, if it’s so necessary. But
it would be better to get to sleep.
Anna, I must warn you,
Warn me?
Of what?
Yes, it’s shut up, and so it must be, and
will be in future.
But perhaps
the key may yet be found,
I want to warn you,
that through
thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked
about in society. Your too animated conversation this evening with
Count Vronsky
attracted attention.
You’re always like that,
One time you don’t like my being dull, and another time you
don’t like my being lively. I wasn’t dull. Does that offend you?
Oh, please, don’t do that, I do so dislike it,
Anna, is this you?
But what is it all about?
What do you want of me?
This is what I meant to say to you,
and I beg you to listen to it. I consider jealousy, as you know, a
humiliating and degrading feeling, and I shall never allow myself to be
influenced by it; but there are certain rules of decorum which cannot
be disregarded with impunity. This evening it was not I observed it,
but judging by the impression made on the company, everyone observed
that your conduct and deportment were not altogether what could be
desired.
I positively don’t understand,
He
doesn’t care,
But other people noticed it, and that’s
what upsets him.
You’re not well, Alexey Alexandrovitch,
Well, I’m listening to what’s to come,
and indeed I listen with interest, for I should like to
understand what’s the matter.
To enter into all the details of your feelings I have no right, and
besides, I regard that as useless and even harmful,
Ferreting in one’s soul, one often ferrets out
something that might have lain there unnoticed. Your feelings are an
affair of your own conscience; but I am in duty bound to you, to
myself, and to God, to point out to you your duties. Our life has been
joined, not by man, but by God. That union can only be severed by a
crime, and a crime of that nature brings its own chastisement.
I don’t understand a word. And, oh dear! how sleepy I am, unluckily,
Anna, for God’s sake don’t speak like that!
Perhaps
I am mistaken, but believe me, what I say, I say as much for myself as
for you. I am your husband, and I love you.
Love? Can he love? If he hadn’t heard there was such a thing as love,
he would never have used the word. He doesn’t even know what love is.
Alexey Alexandrovitch, really I don’t understand,
Define
what it is you find....
Pardon, let me say all I have to say. I love you. But I am not
speaking of myself; the most important persons in this matter are our
son and yourself. It may very well be, I repeat, that my words seem to
you utterly unnecessary and out of place; it may be that they are
called forth by my mistaken impression. In that case, I beg you to
forgive me. But if you are conscious yourself of even the smallest
foundation for them, then I beg you to think a little, and if your
heart prompts you, to speak out to me....
I have nothing to say. And besides,
it’s really time to be in bed.
It’s late, it’s late,
Anna! Anna!
Anna, for pity’s sake!...
My God! Forgive me!
Yes, these kisses—that is
what has been bought by this shame. Yes, and one hand, which will
always be mine—the hand of my accomplice.
All is over,
I have nothing but you. Remember that.
I can never forget what is my whole life. For one instant of this
happiness....
Happiness!
For pity’s sake, not a word, not a word
more.
Not a word more,
No, just now I can’t think of it, later on, when
I am calmer.
Later, later,
when I am calmer.
How happy we are now!
This was just how I used to shudder and blush,
thinking myself utterly lost, when I was plucked in physics and did not
get my remove; and how I thought myself utterly ruined after I had
mismanaged that affair of my sister’s that was entrusted to me. And
yet, now that years have passed, I recall it and wonder that it could
distress me so much. It will be the same thing too with this trouble.
Time will go by and I shall not mind about this either.
Well, Nikolay! I mean to get married,
And high time too, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.
Why isn’t the carpenter at the thrashing machine?
Oh, I meant to tell you yesterday, the harrows want repairing. Here
it’s time they got to work in the fields.
But what were they doing in the winter, then?
But what did you want the carpenter for?
Where are the hurdles for the calves’ paddock?
I ordered them to be got ready. What would you have with those
peasants!
It’s not those peasants but this bailiff!
Why, what do I keep you for?
Well, what do you say? Can sowing begin?
Behind Turkin tomorrow or the next day they might begin.
And the clover?
I’ve sent Vassily and Mishka; they’re sowing. Only I don’t know if
they’ll manage to get through; it’s so slushy.
How many acres?
About fifteen.
Why not sow all?
There’s no one to send. What would you have with such a set of
peasants? Three haven’t turned up. And there’s Semyon....
Well, you should have taken some men from the thatching.
And so I have, as it is.
Where are the peasants, then?
Five are making compôte
four are shifting the
oats for fear of a touch of mildew, Konstantin Dmitrievitch.
a touch of mildew
Why, but I told you during Lent to put in pipes,
Don’t put yourself out; we shall get it all done in time.
Ignat!
saddle me....
Which, sir?
Well, let it be Kolpik.
Yes, sir.
That’s all very well, but as God wills.
as God wills.
If we can manage it, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
Why ever shouldn’t you manage it?
We positively must have another fifteen laborers. And they don’t turn
up. There were some here today asking seventy roubles for the summer.
Send to Sury, to Tchefirovka; if they don’t come we must look for
them.
Oh, I’ll send, to be sure,
But there are the horses, too, they’re not good for much.
We’ll get some more. I know, of course,
you
always want to do with as little and as poor quality as possible; but
this year I’m not going to let you have things your own way. I’ll see
to everything myself.
Why, I don’t think you take much rest as it is. It cheers us up to
work under the master’s eye....
So they’re sowing clover behind the Birch Dale? I’ll go and have a
look at them,
You can’t get across the streams, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
All right, I’ll go by the forest.
Well,
Ipat, shall we soon be sowing?
We must get the ploughing done first,
Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
It’s all right, sir, it’ll spring up again,
Please don’t argue,
but do as you’re told.
Yes, sir,
What a
sowing, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
first rate.
Only it’s a work to get about! You drag a ton of earth on your shoes.
Why is it you have earth that’s not sifted?
Well, we crumble it up,
Where did you stop?
Well, master, when summer’s here, mind you don’t scold me for these
rows,
Eh?
Why, you’ll see in the summer time. It’ll look different. Look you
where I sowed last spring. How I did work at it! I do my best,
Konstantin Dmitrievitch, d’ye see, as I would for my own father. I
don’t like bad work myself, nor would I let another man do it. What’s
good for the master’s good for us too. To look out yonder now,
it does one’s heart good.
It’s a lovely spring, Vassily.
Why, it’s a spring such as the old men don’t remember the like of. I
was up home; an old man up there has sown wheat too, about an acre of
it. He was saying you wouldn’t know it from rye.
Have you been sowing wheat long?
Why, sir, it was you taught us the year before last. You gave me two
measures. We sold about eight bushels and sowed a rood.
Well, mind you crumble up the clods,
and keep an eye on Mishka. And if there’s a good crop you shall
have half a rouble for every acre.
Humbly thankful. We are very well content, sir, as it is.
There must be snipe too,
Yes, that’s someone from the railway station,
just the
time to be here from the Moscow train ... Who could it be? What if it’s
brother Nikolay? He did say: ‘Maybe I’ll go to the waters, or maybe
I’ll come down to you.’
Oh, if it were
only some nice person one could talk to a little!
Ah,
Here’s a
delightful visitor! Ah, how glad I am to see you!
I shall find out for certain whether she’s married, or when she’s
going to be married,
Well, you didn’t expect me, eh?
I’ve come to see you in the first place,
to have some stand-shooting second, and to sell the
forest at Ergushovo third.
Delightful! What a spring we’re having! How ever did you get along in
a sledge?
In a cart it would have been worse still, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
Well, I’m very, very glad to see you,
Do just as you like, only let it be as soon as possible,
Well, I am glad I managed to get away to you! Now I shall understand
what the mysterious business is that you are always absorbed in here.
No, really, I envy you. What a house, how nice it all is! So bright, so
cheerful!
And your nurse is simply
charming! A pretty maid in an apron might be even more agreeable,
perhaps; but for your severe monastic style it does very well.
Splendid, splendid!
I
feel as if, coming to you, I had landed on a peaceful shore after the
noise and jolting of a steamer. And so you maintain that the laborer
himself is an element to be studied and to regulate the choice of
methods in agriculture. Of course, I’m an ignorant outsider; but I
should fancy theory and its application will have its influence on the
laborer too.
Yes, but wait a bit. I’m not talking of political economy, I’m talking
of the science of agriculture. It ought to be like the natural
sciences, and to observe given phenomena and the laborer in his
economic, ethnographical....
Oh, Agafea Mihalovna,
what salt goose, what herb brandy!... What do you
think, isn’t it time to start, Kostya?
Yes, it’s time,
Kouzma, get ready the trap,
Kostya, give orders that if the merchant Ryabinin comes ... I told him
to come today, he’s to be brought in and to wait for me....
Why, do you mean to say you’re selling the forest to Ryabinin?
Yes. Do you know him?
To be sure I do. I have had to do business with him, ‘positively and
conclusively.’
Positively and conclusively
Yes, it’s wonderfully funny the way he talks. She knows where her
master’s going!
I told them to bring the trap round; or would you rather walk?
No, we’d better drive,
How is it you don’t smoke? A cigar is a sort of thing, not
exactly a pleasure, but the crown and outward sign of pleasure. Come,
this is life! How splendid it is! This is how I should like to live!
Why, who prevents you?
No, you’re a lucky man! You’ve got everything you like. You like
horses—and you have them; dogs—you have them; shooting—you have it;
farming—you have it.
Perhaps because I rejoice in what I have, and don’t fret for what I
haven’t,
Come, tell me how things are going with you,
You don’t admit, I know, that one can be fond of new rolls when one
has had one’s rations of bread—to your mind it’s a crime; but I don’t
count life as life without love,
What am I to do? I’m made that way. And really, one does so
little harm to anyone, and gives oneself so much pleasure....
What! is there something new, then?
Yes, my boy, there is! There, do you see, you know the type of
Ossian’s women.... Women, such as one sees in dreams.... Well, these
women are sometimes to be met in reality ... and these women are
terrible. Woman, don’t you know, is such a subject that however much
you study it, it’s always perfectly new.
Well, then, it would be better not to study it.
No. Some mathematician has said that enjoyment lies in the search for
truth, not in the finding it.
Imagine! One can hear and see the grass growing!
Imagine! the cuckoo already!
Yes, I hear it,
Now it’s
coming!
Tchk! tchk!
What’s that cry?
Oh, don’t you know it? That’s the hare. But enough talking! Listen,
it’s flying!
Can I have missed it?
Here it is!
Well, I’m glad you were successful,
It was a bad shot from the right barrel,
Sh... it’s flying!
Isn’t it time to go home?
Let’s stay a little while,
As you like.
Stiva!
how is it you don’t tell me whether
your sister-in-law’s married yet, or when she’s going to be?
She’s never thought of being married, and isn’t thinking of it; but
she’s very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad. They’re
positively afraid she may not live.
What!
Very ill? What is wrong with her? How has
she...?
They have chosen a time to talk,
It’s on the
wing.... Here it is, yes, it is. They’ll miss it,
Splendid! Together!
Oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?
Yes, Kitty’s
ill.... Well, it can’t be helped; I’m very sorry,
She’s found it! Isn’t she a clever thing?
I’ve got it, Stiva!
I have no right whatever to know family matters, and, to tell the
truth, no interest in them either.
Have you quite settled about the forest with Ryabinin?
Yes, it’s settled. The price is magnificent; thirty-eight thousand.
Eight straight away, and the rest in six years. I’ve been bothering
about it for ever so long. No one would give more.
Then you’ve as good as given away your forest for nothing,
How do you mean for nothing?
Because the forest is worth at least a hundred and fifty roubles the
acre,
Oh, these farmers!
Your tone of
contempt for us poor townsfolk!... But when it comes to business, we do
it better than anyone. I assure you I have reckoned it all out,
and the forest is fetching a very good price—so much so that I’m
afraid of this fellow’s crying off, in fact. You know it’s not
‘timber,’
And it
won’t run to more than twenty-five yards of fagots per acre, and he’s
giving me at the rate of seventy roubles the acre.
I know,
that fashion not
only in him, but in all city people, who, after being twice in ten
years in the country, pick up two or three phrases and use them in
season and out of season, firmly persuaded that they know all about it.
‘_Timber, run to so many yards the acre._’ He says those words without
understanding them himself.
I wouldn’t attempt to teach you what you write about in your office,
and if need arose, I should come to you to ask about it. But
you’re so positive you know all the lore of the forest. It’s difficult.
Have you counted the trees?
How count the trees?
Count the sands of the sea,
number the stars. Some higher power might do it.
Oh, well, the higher power of Ryabinin can. Not a single merchant ever
buys a forest without counting the trees, unless they get it given them
for nothing, as you’re doing now. I know your forest. I go there every
year shooting, and your forest’s worth a hundred and fifty roubles an
acre paid down, while he’s giving you sixty by installments. So that in
fact you’re making him a present of thirty thousand.
Come, don’t let your imagination run away with you,
Why was it none would give it, then?
Why, because he has an understanding with the merchants; he’s bought
them off. I’ve had to do with all of them; I know them. They’re not
merchants, you know: they’re speculators. He wouldn’t look at a bargain
that gave him ten, fifteen per cent. profit, but holds back to buy a
rouble’s worth for twenty kopecks.
Well, enough of it! You’re out of temper.
Not the least,
So here you are,
That’s capital.
I did not venture to disregard your excellency’s commands, though the
road was extremely bad. I positively walked the whole way, but I am
here at my time. Konstantin Dmitrievitch, my respects
Your honors
have been diverting yourselves with the chase? What kind of bird may it
be, pray?
a
great delicacy, I suppose.
Would you like to go into my study?
Go into my study; you can talk
there.
Quite so, where you please,
Well, have you brought the money?
Sit down.
Oh, don’t trouble about the money. I’ve come to see you to talk it
over.
What is there to talk over? But do sit down.
I don’t mind if I do,
You must knock it down a bit, prince. It would
be too bad. The money is ready conclusively to the last farthing. As to
paying the money down, there’ll be no hitch there.
Why, you’ve got the forest for nothing as it is,
He came to
me too late, or I’d have fixed the price for him.
Very close about money is Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
there’s positively no dealing
with him. I was bargaining for some wheat of him, and a pretty price I
offered too.
Why should I give you my goods for nothing? I didn’t pick it up on the
ground, nor steal it either.
Mercy on us! nowadays there’s no chance at all of stealing. With the
open courts and everything done in style, nowadays there’s no question
of stealing. We are just talking things over like gentlemen. His
excellency’s asking too much for the forest. I can’t make both ends
meet over it. I must ask for a little concession.
But is the thing settled between you or not? If it’s settled, it’s
useless haggling; but if it’s not,
I’ll buy the forest.
Here you are, the forest is mine,
Take the money; it’s my forest. That’s
Ryabinin’s way of doing business; he doesn’t haggle over every
half-penny,
I wouldn’t be in a hurry if I were you,
Come, really,
I’ve given my word, you
know.
It’s all youthfulness—positively nothing but boyishness. Why, I’m
buying it, upon my honor, simply, believe me, for the glory of it, that
Ryabinin, and no one else, should have bought the copse of Oblonsky.
And as to the profits, why, I must make what God gives. In God’s name.
If you would kindly sign the title-deed....
Ugh, these gentlefolks!
They—they’re a nice
lot!
That’s so,
But I can congratulate you on the purchase, Mihail
Ignatitch?
Well, well....
Well, finished?
Would
you like supper?
Well, I wouldn’t say no to it. What an appetite I get in the country!
Wonderful! Why didn’t you offer Ryabinin something?
Oh, damn him!
Still, how you do treat him!
You didn’t even shake
hands with him. Why not shake hands with him?
Because I don’t shake hands with a waiter, and a waiter’s a hundred
times better than he is.
What a reactionist you are, really! What about the amalgamation of
classes?
Anyone who likes amalgamating is welcome to it, but it sickens me.
You’re a regular reactionist, I see.
Really, I have never considered what I am. I am Konstantin Levin, and
nothing else.
And Konstantin Levin very much out of temper,
Yes, I am out of temper, and do you know why? Because—excuse me—of
your stupid sale....
Come, enough about it!
When did anybody ever sell anything
without being told immediately after the sale, ‘It was worth much
more’? But when one wants to sell, no one will give anything.... No, I
see you’ve a grudge against that unlucky Ryabinin.
Maybe I have. And do you know why? You’ll say again that I’m a
reactionist, or some other terrible word; but all the same it does
annoy and anger me to see on all sides the impoverishing of the
nobility to which I belong, and, in spite of the amalgamation of
classes, I’m glad to belong. And their impoverishment is not due to
extravagance—that would be nothing; living in good style—that’s the
proper thing for noblemen; it’s only the nobles who know how to do it.
Now the peasants about us buy land, and I don’t mind that. The
gentleman does nothing, while the peasant works and supplants the idle
man. That’s as it ought to be. And I’m very glad for the peasant. But I
do mind seeing the process of impoverishment from a sort of—I don’t
know what to call it—innocence. Here a Polish speculator bought for
half its value a magnificent estate from a young lady who lives in
Nice. And there a merchant will get three acres of land, worth ten
roubles, as security for the loan of one rouble. Here, for no kind of
reason, you’ve made that rascal a present of thirty thousand roubles.
Well, what should I have done? Counted every tree?
Of course, they must be counted. You didn’t count them, but Ryabinin
did. Ryabinin’s children will have means of livelihood and education,
while yours maybe will not!
Well, you must excuse me, but there’s something mean in this counting.
We have our business and they have theirs, and they must make their
profit. Anyway, the thing’s done, and there’s an end of it. And here
come some poached eggs, my favorite dish. And Agafea Mihalovna will
give us that marvelous herb-brandy....
Well, you do praise it, anyway,
but
Konstantin Dmitrievitch, give him what you will—a crust of bread—he’ll
eat it and walk away.
How wonderfully they make this soap,
Only look; why, it’s a work of
art.
Yes, everything’s brought to such a pitch of perfection nowadays,
The theater,
for instance, and the entertainments ... a—a—a!
The
electric light everywhere ... a—a—a!
Yes, the electric light,
Yes. Oh, and where’s Vronsky
now?
Vronsky?
he’s in
Petersburg. He left soon after you did, and he’s not once been in
Moscow since. And do you know, Kostya, I’ll tell you the truth,
It’s your own fault. You took fright at the sight of
your rival. But, as I told you at the time, I couldn’t say which had
the better chance. Why didn’t you fight it out? I told you at the time
that....
Does he know, or doesn’t he, that I did make an offer?
Yes, there’s something humbugging, diplomatic
in his face,
If there was anything on her side at the time, it was nothing but a
superficial attraction,
His being such a perfect
aristocrat, don’t you know, and his future position in society, had an
influence not with her, but with her mother.
Stay, stay,
You talk of his being
an aristocrat. But allow me to ask what it consists in, that
aristocracy of Vronsky or of anybody else, beside which I can be looked
down upon? You consider Vronsky an aristocrat, but I don’t. A man whose
father crawled up from nothing at all by intrigue, and whose mother—God
knows whom she wasn’t mixed up with.... No, excuse me, but I consider
myself aristocratic, and people like me, who can point back in the past
to three or four honorable generations of their family, of the highest
degree of breeding (talent and intellect, of course that’s another
matter), and have never curried favor with anyone, never depended on
anyone for anything, like my father and my grandfather. And I know many
such. You think it mean of me to count the trees in my forest, while
you make Ryabinin a present of thirty thousand; but you get rents from
your lands and I don’t know what, while I don’t and so I prize what’s
come to me from my ancestors or been won by hard work.... We are
aristocrats, and not those who can only exist by favor of the powerful
of this world, and who can be bought for twopence halfpenny.
Well, but whom are you attacking? I agree with you,
Whom are
you attacking? Though a good deal is not true that you say about
Vronsky, but I won’t talk about that. I tell you straight out, if I
were you, I should go back with me to Moscow, and....
No; I don’t know whether you know it or not, but I don’t care. And I
tell you—I did make an offer and was rejected, and Katerina
Alexandrovna is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating
reminiscence.
What ever for? What nonsense!
But we won’t talk about it. Please forgive me, if I’ve been nasty,
You’re not angry with me, Stiva? Please don’t be
angry,
Of course not; not a bit, and no reason to be. I’m glad we’ve spoken
openly. And do you know, stand-shooting in the morning is unusually
good—why not go? I couldn’t sleep the night anyway, but I might go
straight from shooting to the station.
Capital.
Of course I shall say Betsy has sent me to ask whether she’s coming to
the races. Of course, I’ll go,
Send to my house, and tell them to have out the carriage and three
horses as quick as they can,
What? Fortifying yourself for your work?
As you see,
So you’re not afraid of getting fat?
What?
You’re not afraid of getting fat?
Waiter, sherry!
You choose what we’re to drink,
Rhine wine, please,
Let’s go into the billiard room,
Ah! here he is!
That’s it, Alexey,
You must
just eat a mouthful, now, and drink only one tiny glass.
Oh, I’m not hungry.
There go the inseparables,
Why didn’t you turn up at the Red Theater yesterday? Numerova wasn’t
at all bad. Where were you?
I was late at the Tverskoys’,
Ah!
Ah! yes,
Well, and what did you do yesterday? Win anything?
Eight thousand. But three don’t count; he won’t pay up.
Oh, then you can afford to lose over me,
No chance of my losing. Mahotin’s the only one that’s risky.
Come along, I’ve finished,
It’s too early for me to dine, but I must have a drink. I’ll come
along directly. Hi, wine!
No, all right,
You’re going
home, so I’ll go with you.
Get up, don’t go on sleeping,
Your brother’s been here,
He waked me up, damn
him, and said he’d look in again.
Oh, do shut up, Yashvin!
Shut up!
You’d better tell me what to drink;
such a nasty taste in my mouth, that....
Brandy’s better than anything,
Tereshtchenko! brandy
for your master and cucumbers,
Brandy, do you think? Eh?
And you’ll drink something? All right then, we’ll have a drink
together! Vronsky, have a drink?
There was a
king in Thule.
Vronsky, will you have a drink?
Go along,
Where are you off to?
Oh, here are your three
horses,
To the stables, and I’ve got to see Bryansky, too, about the horses,
Oh, yes, we know your Bryansky.
Mind you’re not late!
How’s my roan? is he doing all right?
Stop!
Your
brother left a letter and a note for you. Wait a bit; where are they?
Well, where are they?
Where are they? That’s just the question!
Come, tell me; this is silly!
I have not lighted the fire. Here somewhere about.
Come, enough fooling! Where is the letter?
No, I’ve forgotten really. Or was it a dream? Wait a bit, wait a bit!
But what’s the use of getting in a rage. If you’d drunk four bottles
yesterday as I did you’d forget where you were lying. Wait a bit, I’ll
remember!
Wait a bit! This was how I was lying, and this was how he was
standing. Yes—yes—yes.... Here it is!
What business is it of theirs!
Where are you off to?
I must go to Peterhof.
Has the mare come from Tsarskoe?
Yes, but I’ve not seen her yet.
They say Mahotin’s Gladiator’s lame.
Nonsense! But however are you going to race in this mud?
Here are my saviors!
Here’s
Yashvin ordering me to drink a pick-me-up.
Well, you did give it to us yesterday,
you didn’t let us get a wink of sleep all night.
Oh, didn’t we make a pretty finish!
Volkov climbed
onto the roof and began telling us how sad he was. I said: ‘Let’s have
music, the funeral march!’ He fairly dropped asleep on the roof over
the funeral march.
Drink it up; you positively must drink the brandy, and then seltzer
water and a lot of lemon,
and then a little champagne—just
a small bottle.
Come, there’s some sense in that. Stop a bit, Vronsky. We’ll all have
a drink.
No; good-bye all of you. I’m not going to drink today.
Why, are you gaining weight? All right, then we must have it alone.
Give us the seltzer water and lemon.
Vronsky!
Well?
You’d better get your hair cut, it’ll weigh you down, especially at
the top.
To the stables!
Later!
stable boy,
Well, how’s Frou-Frou?
All right, sir,
Better not go in,
I’ve put a muzzle on her, and the mare’s fidgety. Better not go in,
it’ll excite the mare.
No, I’m going in. I want to look at her.
Come along, then,
The horse is here belonging to Mak... Mak... I never can say the
name,
Mahotin? Yes, he’s my most serious rival,
If you were riding him,
I’d bet on you.
Frou-Frou’s more nervous; he’s stronger,
In a steeplechase it all depends on riding and on pluck,
pluck
Don’t you think I want more thinning down?
Oh, no,
Please, don’t speak loud. The
mare’s fidgety,
There, you see how fidgety she is,
There, darling! There!
Quiet, darling, quiet!
Well, I rely on you, then,
half-past six
on the ground.
All right,
Oh, where are you going, my lord?
my lord,
I’ve got to go to Bryansky’s; I shall be home within an hour.
How often I’m asked that question today!
The great thing’s to keep quiet before a race,
don’t get
out of temper or upset about anything.
All right,
What a pity!
It was muddy before, now it will be a perfect swamp.
What business is it of theirs? Why
does everybody feel called upon to concern himself about me? And why do
they worry me so? Just because they see that this is something they
can’t understand. If it were a common, vulgar, worldly intrigue, they
would have left me alone. They feel that this is something different,
that this is not a mere pastime, that this woman is dearer to me than
life. And this is incomprehensible, and that’s why it annoys them.
Whatever our destiny is or may be, we have made it ourselves, and we do
not complain of it,
No, they must needs teach us how to live. They haven’t an idea
of what happiness is; they don’t know that without our love, for us
there is neither happiness nor unhappiness—no life at all,
Yes, she was unhappy before, but proud and at peace; and now she
cannot be at peace and feel secure in her dignity, though she does not
show it. Yes, we must put an end to it,
Throw up everything, she and I, and hide ourselves somewhere
alone with our love,
Has your master come?
No, sir. The mistress is at home. But will you please go to the front
door; there are servants there,
They’ll open
the door.
No, I’ll go in from the garden.
What does it mean? Who is he? How ought I to love him? If I don’t
know, it’s my fault; either I’m stupid or a naughty boy,
What’s the matter? You are ill?
No, I’m quite well,
I did not expect ... thee.
Mercy! what cold hands!
You startled me,
I’m alone, and expecting Seryozha; he’s
out for a walk; they’ll come in from this side.
Forgive me for coming, but I couldn’t pass the day without seeing
you,
Forgive you? I’m so glad!
But you’re ill or worried,
What were you thinking of?
Always the same thing,
Tell him or not tell him?
He is so happy, so absorbed in his races that he
won’t understand as he ought, he won’t understand all the gravity of
this fact to us.
But you haven’t told me what you were thinking of when I came in,
please tell me!
I see something has happened. Do you suppose I can be at peace,
knowing you have a trouble I am not sharing? Tell me, for God’s sake,
Yes, I shan’t be able to forgive him if he does not realize all the
gravity of it. Better not tell; why put him to the proof?
For God’s sake!
Shall I tell you?
Yes, yes, yes....
I’m with child,
Yes, he realizes all the gravity of it,
Yes,
Neither you nor I have
looked on our relations as a passing amusement, and now our fate is
sealed. It is absolutely necessary to put an end
to the deception in which we are living.
Put an end? How put an end, Alexey?
Leave your husband and make our life one.
It is one as it is,
Yes, but altogether; altogether.
But how, Alexey, tell me how?
Is there any way out of such a
position? Am I not the wife of my husband?
There is a way out of every position. We must take our line,
Anything’s better than the position in which you’re living. Of course,
I see how you torture yourself over everything—the world and your son
and your husband.
Oh, not over my husband,
I don’t know
him, I don’t think of him. He doesn’t exist.
You’re not speaking sincerely. I know you. You worry about him too.
Oh, he doesn’t even know,
But we won’t talk of him.
Whether he knows or not,
that’s nothing to do with us. We cannot ... you cannot
stay like this, especially now.
What’s to be done, according to you?
Tell him everything, and leave him.
Very well, let us suppose I do that,
Do you know what the
result of that would be? I can tell you it all beforehand,
‘Eh, you love another man, and have entered into criminal
intrigues with him?’
criminal,
‘I warned you of
the results in the religious, the civil, and the domestic relation. You
have not listened to me. Now I cannot let you disgrace my name,—’
and
my son,
‘disgrace my name, and’—and more in the same style,
In general terms, he’ll say in his official manner, and with all
distinctness and precision, that he cannot let me go, but will take all
measures in his power to prevent scandal. And he will calmly and
punctually act in accordance with his words. That’s what will happen.
He’s not a man, but a machine, and a spiteful machine when he’s angry,
But, Anna,
we absolutely must, anyway, tell him, and then be guided
by the line he takes.
What, run away?
And why not run away? I don’t see how we can keep on like this. And
not for my sake—I see that you suffer.
Yes, run away, and become your mistress,
Anna,
Yes,
become your mistress, and complete the ruin
of....
my son,
I beg you, I entreat you,
never speak to
me of that!
But, Anna....
Never. Leave it to me. I know all the baseness, all the horror of my
position; but it’s not so easy to arrange as you think. And leave it to
me, and do what I say. Never speak to me of it. Do you promise me?...
No, no, promise!...
I promise everything, but I can’t be at peace, especially after what
you have told me. I can’t be at peace, when you can’t be at peace....
I?
Yes, I am worried sometimes; but that will pass, if
you will never talk about this. When you talk about it—it’s only then
it worries me.
I don’t understand,
I know,
how hard it is for your truthful nature
to lie, and I grieve for you. I often think that you have ruined your
whole life for me.
I was just thinking the very same thing,
how could you
sacrifice everything for my sake? I can’t forgive myself that you’re
unhappy!
I unhappy?
I am like a hungry man who has been given
food. He may be cold, and dressed in rags, and ashamed, but he is not
unhappy. I unhappy? No, this is my unhappiness....
When?
Tonight, at one o’clock,
Well, _au revoir_,
I must soon be getting ready
for the races. Betsy promised to fetch me.
Where’s Cord?
In the stable, putting on the saddle.
I’m not too late?
All right! All right!
don’t upset yourself!
Did you get my note?
There’s never any finding you.
I got it, and I really can’t make out what _you_ are worrying yourself
about,
I’m worrying myself because the remark has just been made to me that
you weren’t here, and that you were seen in Peterhof on Monday.
There are matters which only concern those directly interested in
them, and the matter you are so worried about is....
Yes, but if so, you may as well cut the service....
I beg you not to meddle, and that’s all I have to say.
I only wanted to give you Mother’s letter. Answer it, and don’t worry
about anything just before the race. _Bonne chance,_
So you won’t recognize your friends! How are you, _mon cher?_
I came up yesterday, and I’m delighted that
I shall see your triumph. When shall we meet?
Come tomorrow to the messroom,
Oh, there’s Karenin!
He’s looking for his wife, and she’s in the middle of the pavilion.
Didn’t you see her?
No,
Mount!
Get up; you won’t feel so excited.
weak nerves
Don’t be in a hurry,
and remember one thing:
don’t hold her in at the fences, and don’t urge her on; let her go as
she likes.
All right, all right,
If you can, lead the race; but don’t lose heart till the last minute,
even if you’re behind.
Away!
They’re off! They’re starting!
O the darling!
devil,
Bravo!
Bravo, Vronsky!
O my sweet!
He’s cleared it!
A—a—a!
Ah! what have I
done!
The race lost! And my fault! shameful, unpardonable!
And the poor darling, ruined mare! Ah! what have I done!
You
would not be open with me,
so much the worse for you. Now you may beg as you please, but I won’t
be open with you. So much the worse for you!
Oh, very well then! you shall burn
for this!
Aha, young
man!
How can people descend to that?
how is it they don’t put an end to such a hideous position?
Do this for my sake,
I will do it for the sake of Russia, countess,
A priceless man!
How glad I am you’ve been seeing him!
He’s not well,
and I fancy.... Well, what do you think of him?
I’ll tell you,
It’s just this,
if you don’t strain the strings, and then try to break them,
you’ll find it a difficult job; but strain a string to its very utmost,
and the mere weight of one finger on the strained string will snap it.
And with his close assiduity, his conscientious devotion to his work,
he’s strained to the utmost; and there’s some outside burden weighing
on him, and not a light one,
Will you be at the races?
Yes, yes, to be sure; it does waste a lot of time,
It’s too early for Betsy,
How unlucky! Can he be going to stay the night?
Ah, how nice of you!
You’re
staying the night, I hope?
and now we’ll go together. Only it’s a pity
I’ve promised Betsy. She’s coming for me.
Oh, I’m not going to separate the inseparables,
I’m going with Mihail Vassilievitch. I’m ordered
exercise by the doctors too. I’ll walk, and fancy myself at the springs
again.
There’s no hurry,
Would you like tea?
Bring in tea, and tell Seryozha that Alexey Alexandrovitch is here.
Well, tell me, how have you been? Mihail Vassilievitch, you’ve not been
to see me before. Look how lovely it is out on the terrace,
You don’t look quite well,
Yes,
the doctor’s been with me today and wasted an hour of
my time. I feel that someone of our friends must have sent him: my
health’s so precious, it seems.
No; what did he say?
Ah, the young man! He’s grown. Really, he’s getting quite a man. How
are you, young man?
It’s time to start, though,
How is
it Betsy doesn’t come?...
Yes,
I’ve come to bring you some money, too, for
nightingales, we know, can’t live on fairy tales,
You want
it, I expect?
No, I don’t ... yes, I do,
But you’ll come back here after
the races, I suppose?
Oh, yes!
And here’s the glory of
Peterhof, Princess Tverskaya,
What elegance! Charming! Well, let us be starting too, then.
I’m going; good-bye!
It was ever so
nice of you to come.
Well, _au revoir_, then! You’ll come back for some tea; that’s
delightful!
Nothing
but ambition, nothing but the desire to get on, that’s all there is in
his soul,
as for these lofty ideals, love of culture,
religion, they are only so many tools for getting on.
Alexey Alexandrovitch!
I’m sure you
don’t see your wife: here she is.
There’s so much splendor here that one’s eyes are dazzled,
I’m a wicked woman, a lost woman,
but I don’t like
lying, I can’t endure falsehood, while as for _him_ (her husband) it’s
the breath of his life—falsehood. He knows all about it, he sees it
all; what does he care if he can talk so calmly? If he were to kill me,
if he were to kill Vronsky, I might respect him. No, all he wants is
falsehood and propriety,
Danger in the races of officers, of cavalry men, is an essential
element in the race. If England can point to the most brilliant feats
of cavalry in military history, it is simply owing to the fact that she
has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men. Sport
has, in my opinion, a great value, and as is always the case, we see
nothing but what is most superficial.
It’s not superficial,
One of the officers,
they say, has broken two ribs.
We’ll admit, princess, that that’s not superficial,
but
internal. But that’s not the point,
we mustn’t forget that those who
are taking part in the race are military men, who have chosen that
career, and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable
side. It forms an integral part of the duties of an officer. Low
sports, such as prize-fighting or Spanish bull-fights, are a sign of
barbarity. But specialized trials of skill are a sign of development.
No, I shan’t come another time; it’s too upsetting,
Isn’t it, Anna?
It is upsetting, but one can’t tear oneself away,
If I’d been a Roman woman I should never have missed a single circus.
You’re not racing?
My race is a harder one,
There are two aspects,
those who take
part and those who look on; and love for such spectacles is an
unmistakable proof of a low degree of development in the spectator, I
admit, but....
Princess, bets!
Who’s your favorite?
Anna and I are for Kuzovlev,
I’m for Vronsky. A pair of gloves?
Done!
But it is a pretty sight, isn’t it?
I admit that manly sports do not....
But here’s this lady too, and others very much moved as well; it’s
very natural,
Ah, I don’t care!
The lions and gladiators will be the next
thing,
Let us go, let us go!
Let us go, if you like,
He’s broken his leg too, so they say,
This
is beyond everything.
Stiva! Stiva!
Once more I offer you my arm if you want to be going,
No, no, let me be, I’ll stay.
For the third time I offer you my arm,
No, Alexey Alexandrovitch; I brought Anna and I promised to take her
home,
Excuse me, princess,
but I see that Anna’s not very well, and I
wish her to come home with me.
I’ll send to him and find out, and let you know,
Is he killed or not? Is it true? Will he come or not? Shall I see him
today?
What an inclination we all have, though, for these cruel spectacles,
I observe....
Eh? I don’t understand,
I am obliged to tell you,
So now we are to have it out,
I am obliged to tell you that your behavior has been unbecoming
today,
In what way has my behavior been unbecoming?
Mind,
What did you consider unbecoming?
The despair you were unable to conceal at the accident to one of the
riders.
I have already begged you so to conduct yourself in society that even
malicious tongues can find nothing to say against you. There was a time
when I spoke of your inward attitude, but I am not speaking of that
now. Now I speak only of your external attitude. You have behaved
improperly, and I would wish it not to occur again.
She is smiling at my suspicions. Yes, she will tell me directly what
she told me before; that there is no foundation for my suspicions, that
it’s absurd.
Possibly I was mistaken,
If so, I beg your pardon.
No, you were not mistaken,
You were not mistaken. I was, and I could not help
being in despair. I hear you, but I am thinking of him. I love him, I
am his mistress; I can’t bear you; I’m afraid of you, and I hate
you.... You can do what you like to me.
Very well! But I expect a strict observance of the external forms of
propriety till such time
as I may take measures to
secure my honor and communicate them to you.
I sent to Alexey to find out how he is, and he writes me he is quite
well and unhurt, but in despair.
So _he_ will be here,
What a good thing I told him
all!
My God, how light it is! It’s dreadful, but I do love to see his face,
and I do love this fantastic light.... My husband! Oh! yes.... Well,
thank God! everything’s over with him.
I hope the roses will soon come back to this pretty little face,
Mademoiselle
Varenka.
Who are you? What are you? Are you really the
exquisite creature I imagine you to be? But for goodness’ sake don’t
suppose,
that I would force my acquaintance on you, I
simply admire you and like you.
I like you too, and you’re very, very
sweet. And I should like you better still, if I had time,
Mamma, couldn’t I speak to her?
Oh, if you want to so much, I’ll find out about her first and make her
acquaintance myself,
What do you see in her out
of the way? A companion, she must be. If you like, I’ll make
acquaintance with Madame Stahl; I used to know her _belle-sœur_,
How wonderfully sweet she is!
Look how natural and sweet it all
is.
It’s so funny to see your _engouements_,
No, we’d
better go back,
What was it?
Scandalous and disgraceful!
The one thing to
be dreaded is meeting Russians abroad. That tall gentleman was abusing
the doctor, flinging all sorts of insults at him because he wasn’t
treating him quite as he liked, and he began waving his stick at him.
It’s simply a scandal!
Oh, how unpleasant!
Well, and how did it end?
Luckily at that point that ... the one in the mushroom hat ...
intervened. A Russian lady, I think she is,
Mademoiselle Varenka?
Yes, yes. She came to the rescue before anyone; she took the man by
the arm and led him away.
There, mamma,
you wonder that I’m enthusiastic about
her.
Allow me to make your acquaintance,
My daughter has lost her heart to you,
Possibly you
do not know me. I am....
That feeling is more than reciprocal, princess,
What a good deed you did yesterday to our poor compatriot!
I don’t remember. I don’t think I did
anything,
Why, you saved that Levin from disagreeable consequences.
Yes, _sa compagne_ called me, and I tried to pacify him, he’s very
ill, and was dissatisfied with the doctor. I’m used to looking after
such invalids.
Yes, I’ve heard you live at Mentone with your aunt—I think—Madame
Stahl: I used to know her _belle-sœur_.
No, she’s not my aunt. I call her mamma, but I am not related to her;
I was brought up by her,
Well, and what’s this Levin going to do?
He’s going away,
Well, see, Kitty, your intense desire to make friends with
Mademoiselle....
Varenka,
that’s what everyone calls me.
I have long wished for this too,
But you are so busy.
Oh, no, I’m not at all busy,
Varenka, mamma’s calling!
Kitty plays, and we have a piano; not a good one, it’s true, but you
will give us so much pleasure,
You have an extraordinary talent,
Look,
what an audience
has collected to listen to you.
I am very glad it gives you pleasure,
Am I to sing again, or
is that enough?
If it had been I,
how proud I should have been! How
delighted I should have been to see that crowd under the windows! But
she’s utterly unmoved by it. Her only motive is to avoid refusing and
to please mamma. What is there in her? What is it gives her the power
to look down on everything, to be calm independently of everything? How
I should like to know it and to learn it of her!
Let’s skip that,
Very well, the next one,
No,
no,
let’s have that one.
Am I right, that you have some reminiscences connected with that
song?
Don’t tell me,
only say if I’m
right.
No, why not? I’ll tell you simply,
Yes, it brings up memories, once painful
ones. I cared for someone once, and I used to sing him that song.
I cared for him, and he cared for me; but his mother did not wish it,
and he married another girl. He’s living now not far from us, and I see
him sometimes. You didn’t think I had a love story too,
I didn’t think so? Why, if I were a man, I could never care for anyone
else after knowing you. Only I can’t understand how he could, to please
his mother, forget you and make you unhappy; he had no heart.
Oh, no, he’s a very good man, and I’m not unhappy; quite the contrary,
I’m very happy. Well, so we shan’t be singing any more now,
How good you are! how good you are!
If I could only be even a little like you!
Why should you be like anyone? You’re nice as you are,
No, I’m not nice at all. Come, tell me.... Stop a minute, let’s sit
down,
Tell me,
isn’t it humiliating to think that a man has disdained your love, that
he hasn’t cared for it?...
But he didn’t disdain it; I believe he cared for me, but he was a
dutiful son....
Yes, but if it hadn’t been on account of his mother, if it had been
his own doing?...
In that case he would have done wrong, and I should not have regretted
him,
But the humiliation,
the humiliation one can never
forget, can never forget,
Where is the humiliation? Why, you did nothing wrong?
Worse than wrong—shameful.
Why, what is there shameful?
You didn’t tell a man, who
didn’t care for you, that you loved him, did you?
Of course not; I never said a word, but he knew it. No, no, there are
looks, there are ways; I can’t forget it, if I live a hundred years.
Why so? I don’t understand. The whole point is whether you love him
now or not,
I hate him; I can’t forgive myself.
Why, what for?
The shame, the humiliation!
Oh! if everyone were as sensitive as you are!
There
isn’t a girl who hasn’t been through the same. And it’s all so
unimportant.
Why, what is important?
Oh, there’s so much that’s important,
Why, what?
Oh, so much that’s more important,
Kitty, it’s cold! Either get a shawl, or come indoors.
It really is time to go in!
I have to go
on to Madame Berthe’s; she asked me to.
What is it, what is this of such importance that
gives you such tranquillity? You know, tell me!
Allow me to see you home,
Yes, how can you go alone at night like this?
Anyway, I’ll send Parasha.
No, I always go about alone and nothing ever happens to me,
that was important,
_Il ne faut jamais rien outrer_,
How is it Anna Pavlovna’s not been to see us for so long?
I’ve asked her, but she seems
put out about something.
No, I’ve not noticed it, maman,
Is it long since you went to see them?
We’re meaning to make an expedition to the mountains tomorrow,
Well, you can go,
Kitty, haven’t you had some misunderstanding with the Petrovs?
Why has she given up sending
the children and coming to see us?
my Kitty,
Yes,
there was something unnatural about Anna Pavlovna,
and utterly unlike her good nature, when she said angrily the day
before yesterday: ‘There, he will keep waiting for you; he wouldn’t
drink his coffee without you, though he’s grown so dreadfully weak.’
Yes, perhaps, too, she didn’t like it when I gave him the rug. It was
all so simple, but he took it so awkwardly, and was so long thanking
me, that I felt awkward too. And then that portrait of me he did so
well. And most of all that look of confusion and tenderness! Yes, yes,
that’s it!
No, it can’t be, it
oughtn’t to be! He’s so much to be pitied!
Present me to your new friends,
I like even your horrid Soden for making you
so well again. Only it’s melancholy, very melancholy here. Who’s that?
Well, she’s the second angel, then,
she
calls Mademoiselle Varenka angel number one.
Oh! Mademoiselle Varenka, she’s a real angel, allez,
Here is papa come,
Of course I know you; I know you very well,
Where are you off to in such haste?
Maman’s here,
She has not slept all
night, and the doctor advised her to go out. I’m taking her her work.
So that’s angel number one?
Come, so we shall see all your friends,
even Madame
Stahl, if she deigns to recognize me.
Why, did you know her, papa?
I used to know her husband, and her too a little, before she’d joined
the Pietists.
What is a Pietist, papa?
I don’t quite know myself. I only know that she thanks God for
everything, for every misfortune, and thanks God too that her husband
died. And that’s rather droll, as they didn’t get on together.
Who’s that? What a piteous face!
That’s Petrov, an artist,
And that’s his
wife,
Poor fellow! and what a nice face he has!
Why don’t
you go up to him? He wanted to speak to you.
Well, let us go, then,
How are
you feeling today?
This is my daughter,
Let me introduce myself.
We expected you yesterday, princess,
I meant to come, but Varenka said that Anna Pavlovna sent word you
were not going.
Not going!
Anita! Anita!
So you sent word to the princess that we weren’t going!
Good morning, princess,
Very glad to make your
acquaintance,
You’ve long been expected,
prince.
What did you send word to the princess that we weren’t going for?
Oh, mercy on us! I thought we weren’t going,
What, when....
Ah! ah!
Oh, poor things!
Yes, papa,
And you must know they’ve three children,
no servant, and scarcely any means. He gets something from the
Academy,
Oh, here’s Madame Stahl,
I don’t know if you remember me, but I must recall myself to thank you
for your kindness to my daughter,
Prince Alexander Shtcherbatsky,
Delighted! I have taken a great fancy to your daughter.
You are still in weak health?
Yes; I’m used to it,
You are scarcely changed at all,
It’s ten or
eleven years since I had the honor of seeing you.
Yes; God sends the cross and sends the strength to bear it. Often one
wonders what is the goal of this life?... The other side!
To do good, probably,
That is not for us to judge,
So you will send me that book,
dear count? I’m very grateful to you,
Ah!
That’s our aristocracy, prince!
She’s just the same,
Did you know her before her illness, prince—that’s to say before she
took to her bed?
Yes. She took to her bed before my eyes,
They say it’s ten years since she has stood on her feet.
She doesn’t stand up because her legs are too short. She’s a very bad
figure.
Papa, it’s not possible!
That’s what wicked tongues say, my darling. And your Varenka catches
it too,
Oh, these invalid ladies!
Oh, no, papa!
Varenka worships her. And then
she does so much good! Ask anyone! Everyone knows her and Aline Stahl.
Perhaps so,
but
it’s better when one does good so that you may ask everyone and no one
knows.
Well, but what did you buy this mass of things for?
One goes for a walk, one looks in a shop, and they ask you to buy.
‘_Erlaucht, Durchlaucht?_’ Directly they say ‘_Durchlaucht_,’ I can’t
hold out. I lose ten thalers.
It’s simply from boredom,
Of course it is. Such boredom, my dear, that one doesn’t know what to
do with oneself.
How can you be bored, prince? There’s so much that’s interesting now
in Germany,
But I know everything that’s interesting: the plum soup I know, and
the pea sausages I know. I know everything.
No, you may say what you like, prince, there’s the interest of their
institutions,
But what is there interesting about it? They’re all as pleased as
brass halfpence. They’ve conquered everybody, and why am I to be
pleased at that? I haven’t conquered anyone; and I’m obliged to take
off my own boots, yes, and put them away too; in the morning, get up
and dress at once, and go to the dining-room to drink bad tea! How
different it is at home! You get up in no haste, you get cross, grumble
a little, and come round again. You’ve time to think things over, and
no hurry.
But time’s money, you forget that,
Time, indeed, that depends! Why, there’s time one would give a month
of for sixpence, and time you wouldn’t give half an hour of for any
money. Isn’t that so, Katinka? What is it? why are you so depressed?
I’m not depressed.
Where are you off to? Stay a little longer,
I must be going home,
Oh, dear! it’s a long while since I’ve laughed so much!
How nice he is, your father!
When shall I see you again?
Mamma meant to go and see the Petrovs. Won’t you be there?
Yes,
They’re getting ready to go away, so I
promised to help them pack.
Well, I’ll come too, then.
No, why should you?
Why not? why not? why not?
No, wait a
minute; why not?
Oh, nothing; your father has come, and besides, they will feel awkward
at your helping.
No, tell me why you don’t want me to be often at the Petrovs’. You
don’t want me to—why not?
I didn’t say that,
No, please tell me!
Tell you everything?
Everything, everything!
Well, there’s really nothing of any consequence; only that Mihail
Alexeyevitch
had meant to leave earlier,
and now he doesn’t want to go away,
Well, well!
Well, and for some reason Anna Pavlovna told him that he didn’t want
to go because you are here. Of course, that was nonsense; but there was
a dispute over it—over you. You know how irritable these sick people
are.
So you’d better not go.... You understand; you won’t be offended?...
And it serves me right! And it serves me right!
How does it serve you right? I don’t understand,
It serves me right, because it was all sham; because it was all done
on purpose, and not from the heart. What business had I to interfere
with outsiders? And so it’s come about that I’m a cause of quarrel, and
that I’ve done what nobody asked me to do. Because it was all a sham! a
sham! a sham!...
A sham! with what object?
Oh, it’s so idiotic! so hateful! There was no need whatever for me....
Nothing but sham!
But with what object?
To seem better to people, to myself, to God; to deceive everyone. No!
now I won’t descend to that. I’ll be bad; but anyway not a liar, a
cheat.
But who is a cheat?
You speak as if....
I don’t talk about you, not about you at all. You’re perfection. Yes,
yes, I know you’re all perfection; but what am I to do if I’m bad? This
would never have been if I weren’t bad. So let me be what I am. I won’t
be a sham. What have I to do with Anna Pavlovna? Let them go their way,
and me go mine. I can’t be different.... And yet it’s not that, it’s
not that.
What is not that?
Everything. I can’t act except from the heart, and you act from
principle. I liked you simply, but you most likely only wanted to save
me, to improve me.
You are unjust,
But I’m not speaking of other people, I’m speaking of myself.
Kitty,
come here, show papa your
necklace.
What’s the matter? Why are you so red?
Nothing,
I’ll be back directly,
She’s still here,
What am I to say to her? Oh, dear!
what have I done, what have I said? Why was I rude to her? What am I to
do? What am I to say to her?
Varenka, forgive me, do forgive me,
I don’t remember what I said. I....
I really didn’t mean to hurt you,
I’ll come when you get married,
I shall never marry.
Well, then, I shall never come.
Well, then, I shall be married simply for that. Mind now, remember
your promise,
the people
the
people,

You wouldn’t believe,
what a pleasure
this rural laziness is to me. Not an idea in one’s brain, as empty as a
drum!
Come, you’ve done enough trudging about in the heat,
No, I must just run round to the counting-house for a minute,
What? taken a stray swarm, Fomitch?
No, indeed, Konstantin Dmitrich! All we can do to keep our own! This
is the second swarm that has flown away.... Luckily the lads caught
them. They were ploughing your field. They unyoked the horses and
galloped after them.
Well, what do you say, Fomitch—start mowing or wait a bit?
Eh, well. Our way’s to wait till St. Peter’s Day. But you always mow
sooner. Well, to be sure, please God, the hay’s good. There’ll be
plenty for the beasts.
What do you think about the weather?
That’s in God’s hands. Maybe it will be fine.
Well, let’s be going,
Why be in such a hurry? Let’s stay a little. But how wet you are! Even
though one catches nothing, it’s nice. That’s the best thing about
every part of sport, that one has to do with nature. How exquisite this
steely water is!
These riverside banks always
remind me of the riddle—do you know it? ‘The grass says to the water:
we quiver and we quiver.’
I don’t know the riddle,
Do you know, I’ve been thinking about you,
It’s beyond everything what’s being done in the district, according to
what this doctor tells me. He’s a very intelligent fellow. And as I’ve
told you before, I tell you again: it’s not right for you not to go to
the meetings, and altogether to keep out of the district business. If
decent people won’t go into it, of course it’s bound to go all wrong.
We pay the money, and it all goes in salaries, and there are no
schools, nor district nurses, nor midwives, nor drugstores—nothing.
Well, I did try, you know,
I
can’t! and so there’s no help for it.
But why can’t you? I must own I can’t make it out. Indifference,
incapacity—I won’t admit; surely it’s not simply laziness?
None of those things. I’ve tried, and I see I can do nothing,
Why is it you can do nothing? You made an attempt and didn’t succeed,
as you think, and you give in. How can you have so little
self-respect?
Self-respect!
I don’t understand. If they’d told me at college that other people
understood the integral calculus, and I didn’t, then pride would have
come in. But in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has
certain qualifications for this sort of business, and especially that
all this business is of great importance.
What! do you mean to say it’s not of importance?
I don’t think it important; it does not take hold of me, I can’t help
it,
Can they have finished
ploughing?
Come, really though,
there’s a limit to everything. It’s very well
to be original and genuine, and to dislike everything conventional—I
know all about that; but really, what you’re saying either has no
meaning, or it has a very wrong meaning. How can you think it a matter
of no importance whether the peasant, whom you love as you assert....
I never did assert it,
...dies without help? The ignorant peasant-women starve the children,
and the people stagnate in darkness, and are helpless in the hands of
every village clerk, while you have at your disposal a means of helping
them, and don’t help them because to your mind it’s of no importance.
It’s both,
I don’t see that it was possible....
What! was it impossible, if the money were properly laid out, to
provide medical aid?
Impossible, as it seems to me.... For the three thousand square miles
of our district, what with our thaws, and the storms, and the work in
the fields, I don’t see how it is possible to provide medical aid all
over. And besides, I don’t believe in medicine.
Oh, well, that’s unfair ... I can quote to you thousands of
instances.... But the schools, anyway.
Why have schools?
What do you mean? Can there be two opinions of the advantage of
education? If it’s a good thing for you, it’s a good thing for
everyone.
Perhaps it may all be very good; but why should I worry myself about
establishing dispensaries which I shall never make use of, and schools
to which I shall never send my children, to which even the peasants
don’t want to send their children, and to which I’ve no very firm faith
that they ought to send them?
Come, now.... In the first place, the dispensary is needed. We
ourselves sent for the district doctor for Agafea Mihalovna.
Oh, well, but I fancy her wrist will never be straight again.
That remains to be proved.... Next, the peasant who can read and write
is as a workman of more use and value to you.
No, you can ask anyone you like,
the man that can read and write is much inferior as a
workman. And mending the highroads is an impossibility; and as soon as
they put up bridges they’re stolen.
Still, that’s not the point,
Do you admit
that education is a benefit for the people?
Yes, I admit it,
If you admit that it is a benefit,
then, as
an honest man, you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with
the movement, and so wishing to work for it.
But I still do not admit this movement to be just,
What! But you said just now....
That’s to say, I don’t admit it’s being either good or possible.
That you can’t tell without making the trial.
Well, supposing that’s so,
supposing that is so, still I don’t see, all the same, what
I’m to worry myself about it for.
How so?
No; since we are talking, explain it to me from the philosophical
point of view,
I can’t see where philosophy comes in,
I’ll tell you, then,
I imagine the mainspring of
all our actions is, after all, self-interest. Now in the local
institutions I, as a nobleman, see nothing that could conduce to my
prosperity, and the roads are not better and could not be better; my
horses carry me well enough over bad ones. Doctors and dispensaries are
no use to me. An arbitrator of disputes is no use to me. I never appeal
to him, and never shall appeal to him. The schools are no good to me,
but positively harmful, as I told you. For me the district institutions
simply mean the liability to pay fourpence halfpenny for every three
acres, to drive into the town, sleep with bugs, and listen to all sorts
of idiocy and loathsomeness, and self-interest offers me no
inducement.
Excuse me,
self-interest
did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs, but we did
work for it.
No!
the
emancipation of the serfs was a different matter. There self-interest
did come in. One longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us, all
decent people among us. But to be a town councilor and discuss how many
dustmen are needed, and how chimneys shall be constructed in the town
in which I don’t live—to serve on a jury and try a peasant who’s stolen
a flitch of bacon, and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts
of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution, and the
president cross-examining my old half-witted Alioshka, ‘Do you admit,
prisoner in the dock, the fact of the removal of the bacon?’ ‘Eh?’
Well, what do you mean to say, then?
I simply mean to say that those rights that touch me ... my interest,
I shall always defend to the best of my ability; that when they made
raids on us students, and the police read our letters, I was ready to
defend those rights to the utmost, to defend my rights to education and
freedom. I can understand compulsory military service, which affects my
children, my brothers, and myself, I am ready to deliberate on what
concerns me; but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of
district council money, or judging the half-witted Alioshka—I don’t
understand, and I can’t do it.
But tomorrow it’ll be your turn to be tried; would it have suited your
tastes better to be tried in the old criminal tribunal?
I’m not going to be tried. I shan’t murder anybody, and I’ve no need
of it. Well, I tell you what,
our district self-government and all
the rest of it—it’s just like the birch branches we stick in the ground
on Trinity Day, for instance, to look like a copse which has grown up
of itself in Europe, and I can’t gush over these birch branches and
believe in them.
Excuse me, but you know one really can’t argue in that way,
I imagine,
that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting
if it is not founded on self-interest, that’s a universal principle, a
philosophical principle,
philosophical
He too has a philosophy of his own at the
service of his natural tendencies,
Come, you’d better let philosophy alone,
The chief problem
of the philosophy of all ages consists just in finding the
indispensable connection which exists between individual and social
interests. But that’s not to the point; what is to the point is a
correction I must make in your comparison. The birches are not simply
stuck in, but some are sown and some are planted, and one must deal
carefully with them. It’s only those peoples that have an intuitive
sense of what’s of importance and significance in their institutions,
and know how to value them, that have a future before them—it’s only
those peoples that one can truly call historical.
As for your dislike of it, excuse my saying so, that’s simply our
Russian sloth and old serf-owner’s ways, and I’m convinced that in you
it’s a temporary error and will pass.
I must have physical exercise, or my temper’ll certainly be ruined,
And send my scythe, please, to Tit, for him to set it, and bring it
round tomorrow. I shall maybe do some mowing myself too,
Yes, sir.
I fancy the fine weather will last. Tomorrow I shall start mowing.
I’m so fond of that form of field labor,
I’m awfully fond of it. I sometimes mow myself with the peasants, and
tomorrow I want to try mowing the whole day.
How do you mean? Just like one of the peasants, all day long?
Yes, it’s very pleasant,
It’s splendid as exercise, only you’ll hardly be able to stand it,
I’ve tried it. It’s hard work at first, but you get into it. I dare
say I shall manage to keep it up....
Really! what an idea! But tell me, how do the peasants look at it? I
suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their master’s being such a
queer fish?
No, I don’t think so; but it’s so delightful, and at the same time
such hard work, that one has no time to think about it.
But how will you do about dining with them? To send you a bottle of
Lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward.
No, I’ll simply come home at the time of their noonday rest.
It’s ready, sir; it’s like a razor, cuts of itself,
Look’ee now, master, once take hold of the rope there’s no letting it
go!
I’ll try not to let it go,
Mind’ee,
It’s not set right; handle’s too high; see how he has to stoop to it,
Press more on the heel,
Never mind, he’ll get on all right,
He’s made a start.... You swing it too wide, you’ll tire yourself
out.... The master, sure, does his best for himself! But see the grass
missed out! For such work us fellows would catch it!
I will
swing less with my arm and more with my whole body,
What are they talking about, and why doesn’t he go back?
Lunch, sir,
Is it really time? That’s right; lunch, then.
The hay will be spoiled,
Not a bit of it, sir; mow in the rain, and you’ll rake in fine
weather!
What do you say to my home-brew, eh? Good, eh?
Look’ee, the little emmets crawling!
Come, master, dinner time!
Come, master, taste my sop,
Could you cut Mashkin Upland too?—what do you think?
As God wills, the sun’s not high. A little vodka for the lads?
Mashkin
Upland’s to be cut—there’ll be some vodka.
Why not cut it? Come on, Tit! We’ll look sharp! We can eat at night.
Come on!
Come, lads, keep it up!
Get along, get along!
I’ll mow you down, look out!
birch
mushrooms,
Another present for my old woman,
We mowed the whole meadow! Oh, it is nice, delicious! And how have you
been getting on?
Mercy! what do you look like!
And the door, do shut
the door!
You must have let in a dozen at least.
Not one, on my honor. But if I have, I’ll catch them. You wouldn’t
believe what a pleasure it is! How have you spent the day?
Very well. But have you really been mowing the whole day? I expect
you’re as hungry as a wolf. Kouzma has got everything ready for you.
No, I don’t feel hungry even. I had something to eat there. But I’ll
go and wash.
Yes, go along, go along, and I’ll come to you directly,
Go along,
make haste,
But what did you do while it was raining?
Rain? Why, there was scarcely a drop. I’ll come directly. So you had a
nice day too? That’s first-rate.
Oh, by the way, there’s a letter for you,
Kouzma, bring it
down, please. And mind you shut the doors.
I have had a letter from Dolly; she’s at
Ergushovo, and everything seems going wrong there. Do ride over and see
her, please; help her with advice; you know all about it. She will be
so glad to see you. She’s quite alone, poor thing. My mother-in-law and
all of them are still abroad.
That’s capital! I will certainly ride over to her,
Or
we’ll go together. She’s such a splendid woman, isn’t she?
They’re not far from here, then?
Twenty-five miles. Or perhaps it is thirty. But a capital road.
Capital, we’ll drive over.
I shall be delighted,
Well, you have an appetite!
Splendid! You can’t imagine what an effectual remedy it is for every
sort of foolishness. I want to enrich medicine with a new word:
_Arbeitskur_.
Well, but you don’t need it, I should fancy.
No, but for all sorts of nervous invalids.
Yes, it ought to be tried. I had meant to come to the mowing to look
at you, but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the
forest. I sat there a little, and went on by the forest to the village,
met your old nurse, and sounded her as to the peasants’ view of you. As
far as I can make out, they don’t approve of this. She said: ‘It’s not
a gentleman’s work.’ Altogether, I fancy that in the people’s ideas
there are very clear and definite notions of certain, as they call it,
‘gentlemanly’ lines of action. And they don’t sanction the gentry’s
moving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas.
Maybe so; but anyway it’s a pleasure such as I have never known in my
life. And there’s no harm in it, you know. Is there?
I can’t help it if they don’t like it. Though I do believe it’s all
right. Eh?
Altogether,
you’re satisfied with your
day?
Quite satisfied. We cut the whole meadow. And such a splendid old man
I made friends with there! You can’t fancy how delightful he was!
Well, so you’re content with your day. And so am I. First, I solved
two chess problems, and one a very pretty one—a pawn opening. I’ll show
it you. And then—I thought over our conversation yesterday.
Eh! our conversation yesterday?
I think you are partly right. Our difference of opinion amounts to
this, that you make the mainspring self-interest, while I suppose that
interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain
degree of advancement. Possibly you are right too, that action founded
on material interest would be more desirable. You are altogether, as
the French say, too _primesautière_ a nature; you must have intense,
energetic action, or nothing.
So that’s what I think it is, my dear boy,
Yes, of course. But, do you know? I won’t stand up for my view,
Whatever was it I was
disputing about?
Of course, I’m right, and he’s right,
and it’s all first-rate. Only I must go round to the counting house and
see to things.
If you want to go out, let’s go together,
Come, we’ll go to the counting house, if you have to go
there.
Oh, heavens!
What, what is the matter?
How’s Agafea Mihalovna’s hand?
I’d positively forgotten her even.
It’s much better.
Well, anyway I’ll run down to her. Before you’ve time to get your hat
on, I’ll be back.
nothing can be done,
the peasants are such a wretched lot,
Just see, now, and you were quite in despair,
Please, some more.
Eat yourself; let’s eat it together ... together.
Mercy! Your new white frock! Tanya! Grisha!
Lily has found a
mushroom!
My, what a beauty! as white as sugar,
but thin....
Yes, she has been ill.
And so they’ve been bathing you too,
No; he’s only three months old,
You don’t say so!
And have you any children?
I’ve had four; I’ve two living—a boy and a girl. I weaned her last
carnival.
How old is she?
Why, two years old.
Why did you nurse her so long?
It’s our custom; for three fasts....
My, she keeps putting on and putting on, and she’ll
never have done!
There’s
some gentleman coming: the master of Pokrovskoe, I do believe.
You’re like a hen with your chickens, Darya Alexandrovna.
Ah, how glad I am to see you!
Glad to see me, but you didn’t let me know. My brother’s staying with
me. I got a note from Stiva that you were here.
From Stiva?
Yes; he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might allow
me to be of use to you,
I know, of course,
that that simply means that you would
like to see me, and I’m exceedingly glad. Though I can fancy that, used
to town housekeeping as you are, you must feel in the wilds here, and
if there’s anything wanted, I’m altogether at your disposal.
Oh, no!
At first things were rather uncomfortable, but
now we’ve settled everything capitally—thanks to my old nurse,
Won’t you get in, sir, we’ll make room this side!
No, I’ll walk. Children, who’d like to race the horses with me?
Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid, Darya Alexandrovna!
there’s no chance of my hurting
or dropping her.
You know, Kitty’s coming here, and is going to spend the summer with
me.
Really,
Then I’ll send you two cows, shall I? If you insist on a bill
you shall pay me five roubles a month; but it’s really too bad of you.
No, thank you. We can manage very well now.
Oh, well, then, I’ll have a look at your cows, and if you’ll allow me,
I’ll give directions about their food. Everything depends on their
food.
Yes, but still all this has to be looked after, and who is there to
look after it?
Kitty writes to me that there’s nothing she longs for so much as quiet
and solitude,
And how is she—better?
Thank God, she’s quite well again. I never believed her lungs were
affected.
Oh, I’m very glad!
Let me ask you, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
why is it you are angry
with Kitty?
I? I’m not angry with her,
Yes, you are angry. Why was it you did not come to see us nor them
when you were in Moscow?
Darya Alexandrovna,
I
wonder really that with your kind heart you don’t feel this. How it is
you feel no pity for me, if nothing else, when you know....
What do I know?
You know I made an offer and that I was refused,
What makes you suppose I know?
Because everybody knows it....
That’s just where you are mistaken; I did not know it, though I had
guessed it was so.
Well, now you know it.
All I knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully
miserable, and that she begged me never to speak of it. And if she
would not tell me, she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else.
But what did pass between you? Tell me.
I have told you.
When was it?
When I was at their house the last time.
Do you know that,
I am awfully, awfully
sorry for her. You suffer only from pride....
Perhaps so,
but....
But she, poor girl ... I am awfully, awfully sorry for her. Now I see
it all.
Well, Darya Alexandrovna, you must excuse me,
Good-bye, Darya Alexandrovna, till we meet again.
No, wait a minute,
Wait a
minute, sit down.
Please, please, don’t let us talk of this,
If I did not like you,
if I
did not know you, as I do know you....
Yes, I understand it all now,
You can’t
understand it; for you men, who are free and make your own choice, it’s
always clear whom you love. But a girl’s in a position of suspense,
with all a woman’s or maiden’s modesty, a girl who sees you men from
afar, who takes everything on trust,—a girl may have, and often has,
such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say.
Yes, if the heart does not speak....
No, the heart does speak; but just consider: you men have views about
a girl, you come to the house, you make friends, you criticize, you
wait to see if you have found what you love, and then, when you are
sure you love her, you make an offer....
Well, that’s not quite it.
Anyway you make an offer, when your love is ripe or when the balance
has completely turned between the two you are choosing from. But a girl
is not asked. She is expected to make her choice, and yet she cannot
choose, she can only answer ‘yes’ or ‘no.’
Yes, to choose between me and Vronsky,
Darya Alexandrovna,
that’s how one chooses a new dress or
some purchase or other, not love. The choice has been made, and so much
the better.... And there can be no repeating it.
Ah, pride, pride!
At the time when you made Kitty an offer she
was just in a position in which she could not answer. She was in doubt.
Doubt between you and Vronsky. Him she was seeing every day, and you
she had not seen for a long while. Supposing she had been older ... I,
for instance, in her place could have felt no doubt. I always disliked
him, and so it has turned out.
_No, that cannot be_....
Darya Alexandrovna,
I appreciate your confidence in
me; I believe you are making a mistake. But whether I am right or
wrong, that pride you so despise makes any thought of Katerina
Alexandrovna out of the question for me,—you understand, utterly out of
the question.
I will only say one thing more: you know that I am speaking of my
sister, whom I love as I love my own children. I don’t say she cared
for you, all I meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves
nothing.
I don’t know!
If you only knew how you are
hurting me. It’s just as if a child of yours were dead, and they were
to say to you: He would have been like this and like that, and he might
have lived, and how happy you would have been in him. But he’s dead,
dead, dead!...
How absurd you are!
Yes, I see it all more and more
clearly,
So you won’t come to see us, then,
when Kitty’s here?
No, I shan’t come. Of course I won’t avoid meeting Katerina
Alexandrovna, but as far as I can, I will try to save her the annoyance
of my presence.
You are very, very absurd,
Very well then, let it be as though we had
not spoken of this. What have you come for, Tanya?
Where’s my spade, mamma?
I speak French, and you must too.
And what does she
talk French with the children for?
how unnatural and
false it is! And the children feel it so: Learning French and
unlearning sincerity,
But why are you going? Do stay a little.
No, I won’t be artificial and talk
French with my children; but my children won’t be like that. All one
has to do is not spoil children, not to distort their nature, and
they’ll be delightful. No, my children won’t be like that.
What weather for haying! What hay it’ll be!
It’s tea, not hay! It’s like scattering
grain to the ducks, the way they pick it up!
Since dinner time they’ve carried a good half of
it.
The last load, eh?
The last, dad!
Who’s that? Your son?
My baby,
What a fine fellow!
The lad’s all right.
Married already?
Yes, it’s two years last St. Philip’s day.
Any children?
Children indeed! Why, for over a year he was innocent as a babe
himself, and bashful too,
Well, the hay! It’s
as fragrant as tea!
Well, what am I going to do? How am I to set about it?
Have a wife? Have work and the necessity of
work? Leave Pokrovskoe? Buy land? Become a member of a peasant
community? Marry a peasant girl? How am I to set about it?
I haven’t slept all
night, though, and I can’t think it out clearly,
I’ll work it out later. One thing’s certain, this night has decided my
fate. All my old dreams of home life were absurd, not the real thing,
It’s all ever so much simpler and better....
How beautiful!
How exquisite it all is in this
exquisite night! And when was there time for that cloud-shell to form?
Just now I looked at the sky, and there was nothing in it—only two
white streaks. Yes, and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed!
What’s that? Someone coming,
No,
however good that life of simplicity and
toil may be, I cannot go back to it. I love _her_.
He
will get angry, and will not listen to you,
I can do nothing. Kindly leave the room!
No honor, no heart, no religion; a corrupt woman. I always knew it and
always saw it, though I tried to deceive myself to spare her,
I made a mistake in linking my life to
hers; but there was nothing wrong in my mistake, and so I cannot be
unhappy. It’s not I that am to blame,
but she. But I
have nothing to do with her. She does not exist for me....
I cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has
committed a crime. I have only to find the best way out of the
difficult position in which she has placed me. And I shall find it,
I’m not the first nor the
last.

even Dram, such an honest, capable fellow ... Semyonov, Tchagin,
Sigonin,
Admitting that a certain
quite irrational _ridicule_ falls to the lot of these men, yet I never
saw anything but a misfortune in it, and always felt sympathy for it,
It is a misfortune which may befall anyone. And this misfortune has
befallen me. The only thing to be done is to make the best of the
position.
Daryalov fought a duel....
There’s no doubt our society is still so barbarous (it’s not the same

son? I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with
her. But what is more probable and what would doubtless occur—I should
be killed or wounded. I, the innocent person, should be the
victim—killed or wounded. It’s even more senseless. But apart from
that, a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side.
Don’t I know perfectly well that my friends would never allow me to
fight a duel—would never allow the life of a statesman, needed by
Russia, to be exposed to danger? Knowing perfectly well beforehand that
the matter would never come to real danger, it would amount to my
simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge.
That would be dishonest, that would be false, that would be deceiving
myself and others. A duel is quite irrational, and no one expects it of
me. My aim is simply to safeguard my reputation, which is essential for
the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties.
Apart from formal divorce, One might still do like Karibanov,
Paskudin, and that good fellow Dram—that is, separate from one’s wife,
No, it’s out of the question, out
of the question!
I
cannot be unhappy, but neither she nor he ought to be happy.
I must
inform her of my conclusion, that thinking over the terrible position
in which she has placed her family, all other solutions will be worse
for both sides than an external _status quo_, and that such I agree to
retain, on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes,
that is to say, cessation of all intercourse with her lover.
By such a course
only shall I be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion,
In adopting this course, I am not casting off a guilty
wife, but giving her a chance of amendment; and, indeed, difficult as
the task will be to me, I shall devote part of my energies to her
reformation and salvation.
Yes, time will
pass; time, which arranges all things, and the old relations will be
reestablished,
so far
reestablished, that is, that I shall not be sensible of a break in the
continuity of my life. She is bound to be unhappy, but I am not to
blame, and so I cannot be unhappy.
The horses can be taken out and I will see no one,
see no one.
_vous_,
At our last conversation, I notified you of my intention to
communicate to you my decision in regard to the subject of that
conversation. Having carefully considered everything, I am writing now
with the object of fulfilling that promise. My decision is as follows.
Whatever your conduct may have been, I do not consider myself justified
in breaking the ties in which we are bound by a Higher Power. The
family cannot be broken up by a whim, a caprice, or even by the sin of
one of the partners in the marriage, and our life must go on as it has
done in the past. This is essential for me, for you, and for our son. I
am fully persuaded that you have repented and do repent of what has
called forth the present letter, and that you will cooperate with me in
eradicating the cause of our estrangement, and forgetting the past. In
the contrary event, you can conjecture what awaits you and your son.
All this I hope to discuss more in detail in a personal interview. As
the season is drawing to a close, I would beg you to return to
Petersburg as quickly as possible, not later than Tuesday. All
necessary preparations shall be made for your arrival here. I beg you
to note that I attach particular significance to compliance with this
request.

A. Karenin

“_P.S._—I enclose the money which may be needed for your expenses.
Give this to the courier to be delivered to Anna Arkadyevna tomorrow
at the summer villa,
Certainly, your excellency; tea to be served in the study?
brrr,
I saw Vronsky
and did not tell him. At the very instant he was going away I would
have turned him back and told him, but I changed my mind, because it
was strange that I had not told him the first minute. Why was it I
wanted to tell him and did not tell him?
Come,
if only as a study in morals. I shall expect you,
Nothing, I need nothing,
You can go. I’ll dress
at once and come down. I need nothing.
My God! my God!
God
my
Ah, what am I doing!
The coffee is ready, and mademoiselle and Seryozha are waiting,
Seryozha? What about Seryozha?
He’s been naughty, I think,
In what way?
Some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room. I think he
slipped in and ate one of them on the sly.
Ah, mamma!
No, I won’t
take her,
I’ll go alone with my child.
Yes, it’s very wrong,
Leave him to
me,
Mamma! I ... I ... didn’t....
Seryozha,
that
was wrong, but you’ll never do it again, will you?... You love me?
Can I help loving
him?
And can he ever join his father in punishing
me? Is it possible he will not feel for me?
Run along, run along to Mariette,
Can it be that they won’t forgive me, won’t
understand how it all couldn’t be helped?
I mustn’t, mustn’t think,
I must get ready. To
go where? When? Whom to take with me? Yes, to Moscow by the evening
train. Annushka and Seryozha, and only the most necessary things. But
first I must write to them both.
After what
has happened, I cannot remain any longer in your house. I am going
away, and taking my son with me. I don’t know the law, and so I don’t
know with which of the parents the son should remain; but I take him
with me because I cannot live without him. Be generous, leave him to
me.
Of my
fault and my remorse I cannot speak, because....
No,
there’s no need of anything,
I have told my husband,
And what more am I to write to him?
No need of
anything,
Run and find out what it is,
The courier has orders to wait for an answer,
Very well,
Preparations shall be made for your arrival
here ... I attach particular significance to compliance....
He’s right!
of course, he’s always right; he’s a
Christian, he’s generous! Yes, vile, base creature! And no one
understands it except me, and no one ever will; and I can’t explain it.
They say he’s so religious, so high-principled, so upright, so clever;
but they don’t see what I’ve seen. They don’t know how he has crushed
my life for eight years, crushed everything that was living in me—he
has not once even thought that I’m a live woman who must have love.
They don’t know how at every step he’s humiliated me, and been just as
pleased with himself. Haven’t I striven, striven with all my strength,
to find something to give meaning to my life? Haven’t I struggled to
love him, to love my son when I could not love my husband? But the time
came when I knew that I couldn’t cheat myself any longer, that I was
alive, that I was not to blame, that God has made me so that I must
love and live. And now what does he do? If he’d killed me, if he’d
killed him, I could have borne anything, I could have forgiven
anything; but, no, he.... How was it I didn’t guess what he would do?
He’s doing just what’s characteristic of his mean character. He’ll keep
himself in the right, while me, in my ruin, he’ll drive still lower to
worse ruin yet....
You can conjecture what awaits
you and your son....
That’s a threat to take away my child, and most
likely by their stupid law he can. But I know very well why he says it.
He doesn’t believe even in my love for my child, or he despises it
(just as he always used to ridicule it). He despises that feeling in
me, but he knows that I won’t abandon my child, that I can’t abandon my
child, that there could be no life for me without my child, even with
him whom I love; but that if I abandoned my child and ran away from
him, I should be acting like the most infamous, basest of women. He
knows that, and knows that I am incapable of doing that.
Our life must go on as it
has done in the past....
That life was miserable enough in the old
days; it has been awful of late. What will it be now? And he knows all
that; he knows that I can’t repent that I breathe, that I love; he
knows that it can lead to nothing but lying and deceit; but he wants to
go on torturing me. I know him; I know that he’s at home and is happy
in deceit, like a fish swimming in the water. No, I won’t give him that
happiness. I’ll break through the spiderweb of lies in which he wants
to catch me, come what may. Anything’s better than lying and deceit.
But how? My God! my God! Was ever a woman so miserable as I am?...
No; I will break through it, I will break through it!
The courier asks if there’s an answer,
An answer? Yes,
Let him wait. I’ll ring.
What can I write?
What can I decide upon alone? What do
I know? What do I want? What is there I care for?
I ought to see Alexey
no one but he can tell me
what I ought to do. I’ll go to Betsy’s, perhaps I shall see him there,
I have received your letter.—A.
We are not going,
Not going at all?
No; don’t unpack till tomorrow, and let the carriage wait. I’m going
to the princess’s.
Which dress am I to get ready?
_r’s_
From the
count for the princess,
The princess is in the garden; they will inform her immediately. Would
you be pleased to walk into the garden?
I slept badly,
How glad I am you’ve come!
I’m tired, and was just
longing to have some tea before they come. You might go
with Masha, and try the croquet ground over there where
they’ve been cutting it. We shall have time to talk a little over tea;
we’ll have a cozy chat, eh?
Yes, especially as I can’t stay very long with you. I’m forced to go
on to old Madame Vrede. I’ve been promising to go for a century,
No. I’m not going to let you go for anything,
Really, if I were not fond of you, I should
feel offended. One would think you were afraid my society would
compromise you. Tea in the little dining-room, please,
Alexey’s playing us false,
he writes that he
can’t come,
Ah!
How can you or your friends
compromise anyone?
I can’t be more Catholic than the Pope,
Stremov and Liza
Merkalova, why, they’re the cream of the cream of society. Besides,
they’re received everywhere, and _I_
have never been strict and intolerant. It’s simply that I haven’t
the time.
No; you don’t care, perhaps, to meet Stremov? Let him and Alexey
Alexandrovitch tilt at each other in the committee—that’s no affair of
ours. But in the world, he’s the most amiable man I know, and a devoted
croquet player. You shall see. And, in spite of his absurd position as
Liza’s lovesick swain at his age, you ought to see how he carries off
the absurd position. He’s very nice. Sappho Shtoltz you don’t know? Oh,
that’s a new type, quite new.
I must write to Alexey though,
I’m telling him to come to dinner. I’ve one lady extra to dinner with
me, and no man to take her in. Look what I’ve said, will that persuade
him? Excuse me, I must leave you for a minute. Would you seal it up,
please, and send it off?
I have to give some
directions.
It’s essential for me to
see you. Come to the Vrede garden. I shall be there at six o’clock.
She’s very sweet, and I always liked her,
You ought to like her. She raves about you. Yesterday she came up to
me after the races and was in despair at not finding you. She says
you’re a real heroine of romance, and that if she were a man she would
do all sorts of mad things for your sake. Stremov says she does that as
it is.
But do tell me, please, I never could make it out,
do tell me, please, what
are her relations with Prince Kaluzhsky, Mishka, as he’s called? I’ve
met them so little. What does it mean?
It’s a new manner,
They’ve all adopted that manner.
They’ve flung their caps over the windmills. But there are ways and
ways of flinging them.
Yes, but what are her relations precisely with Kaluzhsky?
You’re encroaching on Princess Myakaya’s special domain now. That’s
the question of an _enfant terrible_,
You’d
better ask them,
No; you laugh,
but I
never could understand it. I can’t understand the husband’s rôle in
it.
The husband? Liza Merkalova’s husband carries her shawl, and is always
ready to be of use. But anything more than that in reality, no one
cares to inquire. You know in decent society one doesn’t talk or think
even of certain details of the toilet. That’s how it is with this.
Will you be at Madame Rolandak’s fête?
I don’t think so,
It’s like this, you see: I’m in a fortunate position,
I understand you, and I
understand Liza. Liza now is one of those naïve natures that, like
children, don’t know what’s good and what’s bad. Anyway, she didn’t
comprehend it when she was very young. And now she’s aware that the
lack of comprehension suits her. Now, perhaps, she doesn’t know on
purpose,
But, anyway, it suits her.
The very same thing, don’t you see, may be looked at tragically, and
turned into a misery, or it may be looked at simply and even
humorously. Possibly you are inclined to look at things too
tragically.
How I should like to know other people just as I know myself!
Am I worse than other people, or better?
I think I’m worse.
_Enfant terrible, enfant terrible!_
But here they
are.
Only fancy, we all but ran over two soldiers,
I drove here with Vaska....
Ah, to be sure, you don’t know each other.
You’ve lost your bet. We got here first. Pay up,
Not just now,
Oh, all right, I’ll have it later.
Very well, very well. Oh, yes.
I am a nice person ... I positively forgot it ... I’ve brought you a
visitor. And here he comes.
Ah, how glad I am to see you!
Yesterday
at the races all I wanted was to get to you, but you’d gone away. I did
so want to see you, yesterday especially. Wasn’t it awful?
Yes; I had no idea it would be so thrilling,
I’m not going,
You won’t go either, will you? Who wants to play croquet?
Oh, I like it,
There, how do you manage never to be bored by things? It’s delightful
to look at you. You’re alive, but I’m bored.
How can you be bored? Why, you live in the liveliest set in
Petersburg,
Possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored; but
we—I certainly—are not happy, but awfully, awfully bored.
What, bored!
Sappho says they did enjoy themselves
tremendously at your house last night.
Ah, how dreary it all was!
We all drove back to
my place after the races. And always the same people, always the same.
Always the same thing. We lounged about on sofas all the evening. What
is there to enjoy in that? No; do tell me how you manage never to be
bored?
One has but to look at you
and one sees, here’s a woman who may be happy or unhappy, but isn’t
bored. Tell me how you do it?
I do nothing,
That’s the best way,
‘Nothing,’
that’s the very best way.
I told you long ago,
that if you
don’t want to be bored, you mustn’t think you’re going to be bored.
It’s just as you mustn’t be afraid of not being able to fall asleep, if
you’re afraid of sleeplessness. That’s just what Anna Arkadyevna has
just said.
I should be very glad if I had said it, for it’s not only clever but
true,
No, do tell me why it is one can’t go to sleep, and one can’t help
being bored?
To sleep well one ought to work, and to enjoy oneself one ought to
work too.
What am I to work for when my work is no use to anybody? And I can’t
and won’t knowingly make a pretense about it.
You’re incorrigible,
No, don’t go away, please don’t,
It’s too violent a transition,
to go from such company to
old Madame Vrede. And besides, you will only give her a chance for
talking scandal, while here you arouse none but such different feelings
of the highest and most opposite kind,
If I told her to leave her husband, that must mean uniting her life
with mine; am I prepared for that? How can I take her away now, when I
have no money? Supposing I could arrange.... But how can I take her
away while I’m in the service? If I say that—I ought to be prepared to
do it, that is, I ought to have the money and to retire from the army.
Of course I don’t envy
Serpuhovskoy and never could envy him; but his advancement shows me
that one has only to watch one’s opportunity, and the career of a man
like me may be very rapidly made. Three years ago he was in just the
same position as I am. If I retire, I burn my ships. If I remain in the
army, I lose nothing. She said herself she did not wish to change her
position. And with her love I cannot feel envious of Serpuhovskoy.
We’ve come to fetch you. Your _lessive_ lasted a good time today,
Well, is it over?
It is over,
You’re always just as if you’d come out of a bath after it,
I’ve come from Gritsky’s
they’re expecting you.
Yes; is that music at his place?
What’s the fête?
Serpuhovskoy’s come.
Aha!
why, I didn’t know.
Ah, I’m very glad!
To the health of our former comrade,
the gallant general, Prince Serpuhovskoy. Hurrah!
You always get younger, Bondarenko,
Here he is!
Yashvin told me you were in one of
your gloomy tempers.
How glad I am!
You look after him,
Why weren’t you at the races yesterday? I expected to see you there,
I did go, but late. I beg your pardon,
Please have this divided from me, each man as much as it
runs to.
Vronsky! Have anything to eat or drink?
Hi, something
for the count to eat! Ah, here it is: have a glass!
I’ve always been hearing about you through my wife,
I’m glad you’ve been seeing her pretty often.
She’s friendly with Varya, and they’re the only women in Petersburg I
care about seeing,
The only ones?
Yes; and I heard news of you, but not only through your wife,
I was
greatly delighted to hear of your success, but not a bit surprised. I
expected even more.
Well, I on the contrary expected less—I’ll own frankly. But I’m glad,
very glad. I’m ambitious; that’s my weakness, and I confess to it.
Perhaps you wouldn’t confess to it if you hadn’t been successful,
I don’t suppose so,
I won’t say
life wouldn’t be worth living without it, but it would be dull. Of
course I may be mistaken, but I fancy I have a certain capacity for the
line I’ve chosen, and that power of any sort in my hands, if it is to
be, will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know,
and so the
nearer I get to it, the better pleased I am.
Perhaps that is true for you, but not for everyone. I used to think so
too, but here I live and think life worth living not only for that.
There it’s out! here it comes!
Ever
since I heard about you, about your refusal, I began.... Of course, I
approved of what you did. But there are ways of doing everything. And I
think your action was good in itself, but you didn’t do it quite in the
way you ought to have done.
What’s done can’t be undone, and you know I never go back on what I’ve
done. And besides, I’m very well off.
Very well off—for the time. But you’re not satisfied with that. I
wouldn’t say this to your brother. He’s a nice child, like our host
here. There he goes!
hurrah!
and
he’s happy, but that does not satisfy you.
I didn’t say it did satisfy me.
Yes, but that’s not the only thing. Such men as you are wanted.
By whom?
By whom? By society, by Russia. Russia needs men; she needs a party,
or else everything goes and will go to the dogs.
How do you mean? Bertenev’s party against the Russian communists?
No,
_Tout ça est une blague_. That’s always been and
always will be. There are no communists. But intriguing people have to
invent a noxious, dangerous party. It’s an old trick. No, what’s wanted
is a powerful party of independent men like you and me.
But why so?
Why
aren’t they independent men?
Simply because they have not, or have not had from birth, an
independent fortune; they’ve not had a name, they’ve not been close to
the sun and center as we have. They can be bought either by money or by
favor. And they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a
policy. And they bring forward some notion, some policy that they don’t
believe in, that does harm; and the whole policy is really only a means
to a government house and so much income. _Cela n’est pas plus fin que
ça_, when you get a peep at their cards. I may be inferior to them,
stupider perhaps, though I don’t see why I should be inferior to them.
But you and I have one important advantage over them for certain, in
being more difficult to buy. And such men are more needed than ever.
Still I haven’t the one thing of most importance for that,
I haven’t the desire for power. I had it once, but it’s
gone.
Excuse me, that’s not true,
Yes, it is true, it is true ... now!
Yes, it’s true now, that’s another thing; but that _now_ won’t last
forever.
Perhaps,
You say _perhaps_,
but I say _for certain_. And that’s what I wanted to see you
for. Your action was just what it should have been. I see that, but you
ought not to keep it up. I only ask you to give me _carte blanche_. I’m
not going to offer you my protection ... though, indeed, why shouldn’t
I protect you?—you’ve protected me often enough! I should hope our
friendship rises above all that sort of thing. Yes,
give me _carte blanche_, retire from
the regiment, and I’ll draw you upwards imperceptibly.
But you must understand that I want nothing,
except
that all should be as it is.
You say that all should be as it is. I understand what that means. But
listen: we’re the same age, you’ve known a greater number of women
perhaps than I have.
But I’m married, and believe me, in getting
to know thoroughly one’s wife, if one loves her, as someone has said,
one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them.
We’re coming directly!
And here’s my opinion for you. Women are the chief stumbling block in
a man’s career. It’s hard to love a woman and do anything. There’s only
one way of having love conveniently without its being a
hindrance—that’s marriage. How, how am I to tell you what I mean?
Wait a minute, wait a minute! Yes,
just as you can only carry a _fardeau_ and do something with your
hands, when the _fardeau_ is tied on your back, and that’s marriage.
And that’s what I felt when I was married. My hands were suddenly set
free. But to drag that _fardeau_ about with you without marriage, your
hands will always be so full that you can do nothing. Look at Mazankov,
at Krupov. They’ve ruined their careers for the sake of women.
What women!
The firmer the woman’s footing in society, the worse it is. That’s
much the same as—not merely carrying the _fardeau_ in your arms—but
tearing it away from someone else.
You have never loved,
Perhaps. But you remember what I’ve said to you. And another thing,
women are all more materialistic than men. We make something immense
out of love, but they are always _terre-à-terre_.
Directly, directly!
A man brought it from Princess Tverskaya.
My head’s begun to ache; I’m going home,
Oh, good-bye then. You give me _carte blanche!_
We’ll talk about it later on; I’ll look you up in Petersburg.
I’m happy, very happy!
Get on, get on!
I want nothing, nothing but this happiness,
And as I
go on, I love her more and more. Here’s the garden of the Vrede Villa.
Whereabouts will she be? Where? How? Why did she fix on this place to
meet me, and why does she write in Betsy’s letter?
You’re not angry that I sent for you? I absolutely had to see you,
I angry! But how have you come, where from?
Never mind,
come along, I must
talk to you.
What is it? what?
I did not tell you yesterday,
that coming home with Alexey Alexandrovitch I told him
everything ... told him I could not be his wife, that ... and told him
everything.
Yes, yes, that’s better, a thousand times better! I know how painful
it was,
Throw up
everything and come with me!
It was not in the least painful to me. It happened of itself,
and see....
I understand, I understand,
The one thing I longed
for, the one thing I prayed for, was to cut short this position, so as
to devote my life to your happiness.
Why do you tell me that?
Do you suppose I can doubt it? If
I doubted....
Who’s that coming?
Perhaps they know us!
Oh, I don’t care!
I
tell you that’s not the point—I can’t doubt that; but see what he
writes to me. Read it.
You see the sort of man he is,
he....
Forgive me, but I rejoice at it,
For God’s
sake, let me finish!
I rejoice, because things cannot, cannot
possibly remain as he supposes.
Why can’t they?
It can’t go on. I hope that now you will leave him. I hope
that you will let me arrange and plan our life.
Tomorrow....
But my child!
You see what he writes! I should have to
leave him, and I can’t and won’t do that.
But, for God’s sake, which is better?—leave your child, or keep up
this degrading position?
To whom is it degrading?
To all, and most of all to you.
You say degrading ... don’t say that. Those words have no meaning for
me,
Don’t you understand that from the day I loved you
everything has changed for me? For me there is one thing, and one thing
only—your love. If that’s mine, I feel so exalted, so strong, that
nothing can be humiliating to me. I am proud of my position, because
... proud of being ... proud....
Is not a divorce possible?
Couldn’t you take your son, and still leave him?
Yes; but it all depends on him. Now I must go to him,
On Tuesday I shall be in Petersburg, and everything can be settled.
Yes,
But don’t let us talk any more of it.
I am very glad you have come,
Is Seryozha
quite well?
I
shan’t be dining at home today, and I have got to go out directly.
I had thought of going to Moscow,
No, you did quite, quite right to come,
Alexey Alexandrovitch,
I’m a guilty woman, I’m a
bad woman, but I am the same as I was, as I told you then, and I have
come to tell you that I can change nothing.
I have asked you no question about that,
that was
as I had supposed.
But as I told you then, and
have written to you,
I repeat now,
that I am not bound to know this. I ignore it. Not all wives are so
kind as you, to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news
to their husbands.
agreeable.
I shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it, so long as
my name is not disgraced. And so I simply inform you that our relations
must be just as they have always been, and that only in the event of
your compromising me I shall be obliged to take steps to secure my
honor.
But our relations cannot be the same as always,
I cannot be your wife while I....
The manner of life you have chosen is reflected, I suppose, in your
ideas. I have too much respect or contempt, or both ... I respect your
past and despise your present ... that I was far from the
interpretation you put on my words.
Though indeed I fail to comprehend how, with the independence you
show,
—announcing your infidelity to your
husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it, apparently—you can see
anything reprehensible in performing a wife’s duties in relation to
your husband.
Alexey Alexandrovitch! What is it you want of me?
I want you not to meet that man here, and to conduct yourself so that
neither the world nor the servants can reproach you ... not to see him.
That’s not much, I think. And in return you will enjoy all the
privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties. That’s all
I have to say to you. Now it’s time for me to go. I’m not dining at
home.
Don’t trouble, your honor, sure, the womenfolks will pitch
it quick enough.
Do what you will to me, your honor.
I can’t ask her to
be my wife merely because she can’t be the wife of the man she wanted
to marry,
I should not be able to speak to her without a feeling
of reproach; I could not look at her without resentment; and she will
only hate me all the more, as she’s bound to. And besides, how can I
now, after what Darya Alexandrovna told me, go to see them? Can I help
showing that I know what she told me? And me to go magnanimously to
forgive her, and have pity on her! Me go through a performance before
her of forgiving, and deigning to bestow my love on her!... What
induced Darya Alexandrovna to tell me that? By chance I might have seen
her, then everything would have happened of itself; but, as it is, it’s
out of the question, out of the question!
I’m told you have a side-saddle,
I
hope you will bring it over yourself.
Would you like the samovar?
Yes, please.
Look sharp, my girl!
Well, sir, are you going to Nikolay
Ivanovitch Sviazhsky? His honor comes to us too,
What have they been ploughing?
Ploughing up the potatoes. We rent a bit of land too. Fedot, don’t let
out the gelding, but take it to the trough, and we’ll put the other in
harness.
Oh, father, the ploughshares I ordered, has he brought them along?
There ... in the outer room,
You can
put them on, while they have dinner.
Well, I have had some today already,
But just a glass for company.
What have the wenches to do? They carry it out in bundles to the
roadside, and the cart brings it away.
Well, we landowners can’t manage well with our laborers,
Thank you,
They’re simple destruction,
Look at Sviazhsky’s, for instance. We know what the land’s
like—first-rate, yet there’s not much of a crop to boast of. It’s not
looked after enough—that’s all it is!
But you work your land with hired laborers?
We’re all peasants together. We go into everything ourselves. If a
man’s no use, he can go, and we can manage by ourselves.
Father, Finogen wants some tar,
Yes, yes, that’s how it is, sir!
a fool or a knave,
a fool,
It was not, perhaps, of importance in the days of serfdom,
and it may not be of importance in England. In both cases the
conditions of agriculture are firmly established; but among us now,
when everything has been turned upside down and is only just taking
shape, the question what form these conditions will take is the one
question of importance in Russia,
You say,
that
my husband cannot be interested in what’s Russian. It’s quite the
contrary; he is always in cheerful spirits abroad, but not as he is
here. Here, he feels in his proper place. He has so much to do, and he
has the faculty of interesting himself in everything. Oh, you’ve not
been to see our school, have you?
I’ve seen it.... The little house covered with ivy, isn’t it?
Yes; that’s Nastia’s work,
You teach in it yourself?
Yes; I used to teach in it myself, and do teach still, but we have a
first-rate schoolmistress now. And we’ve started gymnastic exercises.
No, thank you, I won’t have any more tea,
I hear a very interesting conversation,
If I’d only the heart to throw up what’s been set going ... such a lot
of trouble wasted ... I’d turn my back on the whole business, sell up,
go off like Nikolay Ivanovitch ... to hear _La Belle Hélène_,
But you see you don’t throw it up,
so there must be something gained.
The only gain is that I live in my own house, neither bought nor
hired. Besides, one keeps hoping the people will learn sense. Though,
instead of that, you’d never believe it—the drunkenness, the
immorality! They keep chopping and changing their bits of land. Not a
sight of a horse or a cow. The peasant’s dying of hunger, but just go
and take him on as a laborer, he’ll do his best to do you a mischief,
and then bring you up before the justice of the peace.
But then you make complaints to the justice too,
I lodge complaints? Not for anything in the world! Such a talking, and
such a to-do, that one would have cause to regret it. At the works, for
instance, they pocketed the advance-money and made off. What did the
justice do? Why, acquitted them. Nothing keeps them in order but their
own communal court and their village elder. He’ll flog them in the good
old style! But for that there’d be nothing for it but to give it all up
and run away.
But you see we manage our land without such extreme measures,
Levin and I and this gentleman.
Yes, the thing’s done at Mihail Petrovitch’s, but ask him how it’s
done. Do you call that a rational system?
rational.
My system’s very simple,
thank God. All my
management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes, and
the peasants come to me, ‘Father, master, help us!’ Well, the peasants
are all one’s neighbors; one feels for them. So one advances them a
third, but one says: ‘Remember, lads, I have helped you, and you must
help me when I need it—whether it’s the sowing of the oats, or the
haycutting, or the harvest’; and well, one agrees, so much for each
taxpayer—though there are dishonest ones among them too, it’s true.
Then what do you think?
what system is one to adopt
nowadays?
Why, manage like Mihail Petrovitch, or let the land for half the crop
or for rent to the peasants; that one can do—only that’s just how the
general prosperity of the country is being ruined. Where the land with
serf-labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one, on the
half-crop system it yields three to one. Russia has been ruined by the
emancipation!
The point is, don’t you see, that progress of every sort is only made
by the use of authority,
Take the reforms of Peter, of Catherine, of
Alexander. Take European history. And progress in agriculture more than
anything else—the potato, for instance, that was introduced among us by
force. The wooden plough too wasn’t always used. It was introduced
maybe in the days before the Empire, but it was probably brought in by
force. Now, in our own day, we landowners in the serf times used
various improvements in our husbandry: drying machines and thrashing
machines, and carting manure and all the modern implements—all that we
brought into use by our authority, and the peasants opposed it at
first, and ended by imitating us. Now, by the abolition of serfdom we
have been deprived of our authority; and so our husbandry, where it had
been raised to a high level, is bound to sink to the most savage
primitive condition. That’s how I see it.
But why so? If it’s rational, you’ll be able to keep up the same
system with hired labor,
We’ve no power over them. With whom am I going to work the system,
allow me to ask?
There it is—the labor force—the chief element in agriculture,
With laborers.
The laborers won’t work well, and won’t work with good implements. Our
laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a pig, and when he’s drunk he
ruins everything you give him. He makes the horses ill with too much
water, cuts good harness, barters the tires of the wheels for drink,
drops bits of iron into the thrashing machine, so as to break it. He
loathes the sight of anything that’s not after his fashion. And that’s
how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen. Lands gone out of
cultivation, overgrown with weeds, or divided among the peasants, and
where millions of bushels were raised you get a hundred thousand; the
wealth of the country has decreased. If the same thing had been done,
but with care that....
That the standard of culture is falling, and that with our present
relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a
rational system to yield a profit—that’s perfectly true,
I don’t believe it,
all I see is
that we don’t know how to cultivate the land, and that our system of
agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high, but too low. We
have no machines, no good stock, no efficient supervision; we don’t
even know how to keep accounts. Ask any landowner; he won’t be able to
tell you what crop’s profitable, and what’s not.
Italian bookkeeping,
You may keep your books as you like, but if they spoil
everything for you, there won’t be any profit.
Why do they spoil things? A poor thrashing machine, or your Russian
presser, they will break, but my steam press they don’t break. A
wretched Russian nag they’ll ruin, but keep good dray-horses—they won’t
ruin them. And so it is all round. We must raise our farming to a
higher level.
Oh, if one only had the means to do it, Nikolay Ivanovitch! It’s all
very well for you; but for me, with a son to keep at the university,
lads to be educated at the high school—how am I going to buy these
dray-horses?
Well, that’s what the land banks are for.
To get what’s left me sold by auction? No, thank you.
I don’t agree that it’s necessary or possible to raise the level of
agriculture still higher,
I devote myself to it, and I
have means, but I can do nothing. As to the banks, I don’t know to whom
they’re any good. For my part, anyway, whatever I’ve spent money on in
the way of husbandry, it has been a loss: stock—a loss, machinery—a
loss.
That’s true enough,
And I’m not the only one,
I mix with all the
neighboring landowners, who are cultivating their land on a rational
system; they all, with rare exceptions, are doing so at a loss. Come,
tell us how does your land do—does it pay?
Possibly it does not pay,
That merely proves
either that I’m a bad manager, or that I’ve sunk my capital for the
increase of my rents.
Oh, rent!
Rent there may be in Europe,
where land has been improved by the labor put into it, but with us all
the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it—in other words
they’re working it out; so there’s no question of rent.
How no rent? It’s a law.
Then we’re outside the law; rent explains nothing for us, but simply
muddles us. No, tell me how there can be a theory of rent?...
Will you have some junket? Masha, pass us some junket or raspberries.
Extraordinarily late the raspberries are
lasting this year.
What makes you think,
that it’s impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the
labor would become productive?
That never could be so with the Russian peasantry; we’ve no power over
them,
How can new conditions be found?
All
possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied,
The relic of barbarism, the primitive commune with each
guarantee for all, will disappear of itself; serfdom has been
abolished—there remains nothing but free labor, and its forms are fixed
and ready made, and must be adopted. Permanent hands, day-laborers,
rammers—you can’t get out of those forms.
But Europe is dissatisfied with these forms.
Dissatisfied, and seeking new ones. And will find them, in all
probability.
That’s just what I was meaning,
Why shouldn’t we
seek them for ourselves?
Because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for
constructing railways. They are ready, invented.
But if they don’t do for us, if they’re stupid?
Oh, yes; we’ll bury the world under our caps! We’ve found the secret
Europe was seeking for! I’ve heard all that; but, excuse me, do you
know all that’s been done in Europe on the question of the organization
of labor?
No, very little.
That question is now absorbing the best minds in Europe. The
Schulze-Delitsch movement.... And then all this enormous literature of
the labor question, the most liberal Lassalle movement ... the
Mulhausen experiment? That’s a fact by now, as you’re probably aware.
I have some idea of it, but very vague.
No, you only say that; no doubt you know all about it as well as I do.
I’m not a professor of sociology, of course, but it interested me, and
really, if it interests you, you ought to study it.
But what conclusion have they come to?
Excuse me....
What are you looking at there?
Oh, yes, there’s a very interesting article here,
It appears,
that Friedrich was not, after all, the person
chiefly responsible for the partition of Poland. It is proved....
What is there inside of him? And why, why is he
interested in the partition of Poland?
Well, and what then?
Yes, but I was very much interested by your irritable neighbor,
He’s a clever fellow, and said a lot that was true.
Oh, get along with you! An inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart,
like all of them!
Whose marshal you are.
Yes, only I marshal them in the other direction,
I’ll tell you what interests me very much,
He’s right
that our system, that’s to say of rational farming, doesn’t answer,
that the only thing that answers is the money-lender system, like that
meek-looking gentleman’s, or else the very simplest.... Whose fault is
it?
Our own, of course. Besides, it’s not true that it doesn’t answer. It
answers with Vassiltchikov.
A factory....
But I really don’t know what it is you are surprised at. The people
are at such a low stage of rational and moral development, that it’s
obvious they’re bound to oppose everything that’s strange to them. In
Europe, a rational system answers because the people are educated; it
follows that we must educate the people—that’s all.
But how are we to educate the people?
To educate the people three things are needed: schools, and schools,
and schools.
But you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material
development: what help are schools for that?
Do you know, you remind me of the story of the advice given to the
sick man—You should try purgative medicine. Taken: worse. Try leeches.
Tried them: worse. Well, then, there’s nothing left but to pray to God.
Tried it: worse. That’s just how it is with us. I say political
economy; you say—worse. I say socialism: worse. Education: worse.
But how do schools help matters?
They give the peasant fresh wants.
Well, that’s a thing I’ve never understood,
In what way are schools going to help the people to improve their
material position? You say schools, education, will give them fresh
wants. So much the worse, since they won’t be capable of satisfying
them. And in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the
catechism is going to improve their material condition, I never could
make out. The day before yesterday, I met a peasant woman in the
evening with a little baby, and asked her where she was going. She said
she was going to the wise woman; her boy had screaming fits, so she was
taking him to be doctored. I asked, ‘Why, how does the wise woman cure
screaming fits?’ ‘She puts the child on the hen-roost and repeats some
charm....’
Well, you’re saying it yourself! What’s wanted to prevent her taking
her child to the hen-roost to cure it of screaming fits is just....
Oh, no!
that method of doctoring I merely
meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools. The people are
poor and ignorant—that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the
baby is ill because it screams. But in what way this trouble of poverty
and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how
the hen-roost affects the screaming. What has to be cured is what makes
him poor.
Well, in that, at least, you’re in agreement with Spencer, whom you
dislike so much. He says, too, that education may be the consequence of
greater prosperity and comfort, of more frequent washing, as he says,
but not of being able to read and write....
Well, then, I’m very glad—or the contrary, very sorry, that I’m in
agreement with Spencer; only I’ve known it a long while. Schools can do
no good; what will do good is an economic organization in which the
people will become richer, will have more leisure—and then there will
be schools.
Still, all over Europe now schools are obligatory.
And how far do you agree with Spencer yourself about it?
No; that screaming story is positively capital! Did you really hear it
yourself?
Yes, I ought to have said to him: You say that our husbandry does not
answer because the peasant hates improvements, and that they must be
forced on him by authority. If no system of husbandry answered at all
without these improvements, you would be quite right. But the only
system that does answer is where laborer is working in accordance with
his habits, just as on the old peasant’s land half-way here. Your and
our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to
blame or the laborers. We have gone our way—the European way—a long
while, without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force.
Let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force, but
as the _Russian peasant_ with his instincts, and we shall arrange our
system of culture in accordance with that. Imagine, I ought to have
said to him, that you have the same system as the old peasant has, that
you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the
success of the work, and have found the happy mean in the way of
improvements which they will admit, and you will, without exhausting
the soil, get twice or three times the yield you got before. Divide it
in halves, give half as the share of labor, the surplus left you will
be greater, and the share of labor will be greater too. And to do this
one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in
its success. How to do this?—that’s a matter of detail; but undoubtedly
it can be done.
If you would take a rent for the land,
it would save you trouble, and we should be more free.
But Kauffmann, but Jones, but Dubois, but Michelli? You haven’t
read them: they’ve thrashed that question out thoroughly.
I have only to go stubbornly on towards my aim, and I shall attain my
end,
and it’s something to work and take trouble for.
This is not a matter of myself individually; the question of the public
welfare comes into it. The whole system of culture, the chief element
in the condition of the people, must be completely transformed. Instead
of poverty, general prosperity and content; instead of hostility,
harmony and unity of interests. In short, a bloodless revolution, but a
revolution of the greatest magnitude, beginning in the little circle of
our district, then the province, then Russia, the whole world. Because
a just idea cannot but be fruitful. Yes, it’s an aim worth working for.
And its being me, Kostya Levin, who went to a ball in a black tie, and
was refused by the Shtcherbatskaya girl, and who was intrinsically such
a pitiful, worthless creature—that proves nothing; I feel sure Franklin
felt just as worthless, and he too had no faith in himself, thinking of
himself as a whole. That means nothing. And he too, most likely, had an
Agafea Mihalovna to whom he confided his secrets.
I must write
that down,
That ought to form a brief introduction, which
I thought unnecessary before.
What’s the use of being dreary?
Come, why do
you stay on at home? You ought to go to some warm springs, especially
now you’re ready for the journey.
Well, I am going away the day after tomorrow, Agafea Mihalovna; I must
finish my work.
There, there, your work, you say! As if you hadn’t done enough for the
peasants! Why, as ’tis, they’re saying, ‘Your master will be getting
some honor from the Tsar for it.’ Indeed and it is a strange thing; why
need you worry about the peasants?
I’m not worrying about them; I’m doing it for my own good.
Of one’s soul’s salvation we all know and must think before all else,
Parfen Denisitch now, for all he was no scholar,
he died a death that God grant everyone of us the like,
Took the sacrament and
all.
That’s not what I mean,
I mean that I’m acting for my own
advantage. It’s all the better for me if the peasants do their work
better.
Well, whatever you do, if he’s a lazy good-for-nought, everything’ll
be at sixes and sevens. If he has a conscience, he’ll work, and if not,
there’s no doing anything.
Oh, come, you say yourself Ivan has begun looking after the cattle
better.
All I say is,
that you ought to get married,
that’s what I say.
Well, here’s visitors come to us, and you won’t be dull,
You see, I’ve come to you,
I’ve been meaning
to a long while, but I’ve been unwell all the time. Now I’m ever so
much better,
Yes, yes!
Of course he was quite old,
Well,
I’ll spend a month or two with you, and then I’m off to Moscow. Do you
know, Myakov has promised me a place there, and I’m going into the
service. Now I’m going to arrange my life quite differently,
You know I got rid of that woman.
Marya Nikolaevna? Why, what for?
Oh, she was a horrid woman! She caused me all sorts of worries.
Besides, I want to turn over a new leaf completely now. I’ve done
silly things, of course, like everyone else, but money’s the last
consideration; I don’t regret it. So long as there’s health, and my
health, thank God, is quite restored.
Oh, my God!
Ah, the devil!
I work, I want to do something, but I had forgotten it must all end; I
had forgotten—death.
But I am alive still. Now what’s to be done? what’s to be done?
And now that bent, hollow chest ... and I, not knowing
what will become of me, or wherefore....
K...ha! K...ha! Damnation! Why do you keep fidgeting, why don’t you go
to sleep?
Oh, I don’t know, I’m not sleepy.
I have had a good sleep, I’m not in a sweat now. Just see, feel my
shirt; it’s not wet, is it?
Why, he’s dying—yes, he’ll die in the spring, and how help him? What
can I say to him? What do I know about it? I’d even forgotten that it
was at all.
You’re dying,
you’re dying!
I know I’m dying,
but I’m afraid, I’m afraid, I’m afraid!
You’ve simply borrowed an idea that’s not your own, but you’ve
distorted it, and are trying to apply it where it’s not applicable.
But I tell you it’s nothing to do with it. They deny the justice of
property, of capital, of inheritance, while I do not deny this chief
stimulus.
All I want is to
regulate labor.
Which means, you’ve borrowed an idea, stripped it of all that gave it
its force, and want to make believe that it’s something new,
But my idea has nothing in common....
That, anyway,
has the charm of—what’s one to call
it?—geometrical symmetry, of clearness, of definiteness. It may be a
Utopia. But if once one allows the possibility of making of all the
past a _tabula rasa_—no property, no family—then labor would organize
itself. But you gain nothing....
Why do you mix things up? I’ve never been a communist.
But I have, and I consider it’s premature, but rational, and it has a
future, just like Christianity in its first ages.
All that I maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated
from the point of view of natural science; that is to say, it ought to
be studied, its qualities ascertained....
But that’s utter waste of time. That force finds a certain form of
activity of itself, according to the stage of its development. There
have been slaves first everywhere, then metayers; and we have the
half-crop system, rent, and day laborers. What are you trying to find?
I am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for
the laborers. I want to organize....
You don’t want to organize anything; it’s simply just as you’ve been
all your life, that you want to be original to pose as not exploiting
the peasants simply, but with some idea in view.
Oh, all right, that’s what you think—and let me alone!
You’ve never had, and never have, convictions; all you want is to
please your vanity.
Oh, very well; then let me alone!
And I will let you alone! and it’s high time I did, and go to the
devil with you! and I’m very sorry I ever came!
Ah, generosity!
If you want to be
right, I can give you that satisfaction. You’re in the right; but I’m
going all the same.
Anyway, don’t remember evil against me, Kostya!
You see, and you
know, that I’m in a bad way, and maybe we shall not see each other
again.
What’s the matter with you?
Oh, nothing; there’s not much happiness in life.
Not much? You come with me to Paris instead of to Mulhausen. You shall
see how to be happy.
No, I’ve done with it all. It’s time I was dead.
Well, that’s a good one!
why, I’m only
just getting ready to begin.
Yes, I thought the same not long ago, but now I know I shall soon be
dead.
Brainless beef! can I be like that?
I
am ill and unhappy. I cannot come out, but I cannot go on longer
without seeing you. Come in this evening. Alexey Alexandrovitch goes to
the council at seven and will be there till ten.
What was it? What? What was the dreadful
thing I dreamed? Yes, yes; I think a little dirty man with a disheveled
beard was stooping down doing something, and all of a sudden he began
saying some strange words in French. Yes, there was nothing else in the
dream,
But why was it so awful?
What nonsense!
She is coming to me,
and better she should. I don’t like going into that house. But no
matter; I can’t hide myself,
What a position!
If he would fight, would stand up for
his honor, I could act, could express my feelings; but this weakness or
baseness.... He puts me in the position of playing false, which I never
meant and never mean to do.
No,
No; if things are to go on like this, the
end will come much, much too soon.
What is it, dear one?
What? I’ve been waiting in agony for an hour, two hours ... No, I
won’t ... I can’t quarrel with you. Of course you couldn’t come. No, I
won’t.
You met him?
You’re punished, you see, for being late.
Yes; but how was it? Wasn’t he to be at the council?
He had been and come back, and was going out somewhere again. But
that’s no matter. Don’t talk about it. Where have you been? With the
prince still?
But it’s over now? He is gone?
Thank God it’s over! You wouldn’t believe how insufferable it’s been
for me.
Why so? Isn’t it the life all of you, all young men, always lead?
I gave that life up long ago,
And I confess,
this week I’ve been, as it
were, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn’t like
it.
This morning Liza came to see me—they’re not afraid to call on me, in
spite of the Countess Lidia Ivanovna,
and she told me
about your Athenian evening. How loathsome!
I was just going to say....
It was that Thérèse you used to know?
I was just saying....
How disgusting you are, you men! How is it you can’t understand that a
woman can never forget that,
especially a woman
who cannot know your life? What do I know? What have I ever known?
what you tell me. And how do I know whether you tell me the
truth?...
Anna, you hurt me. Don’t you trust me? Haven’t I told you that I
haven’t a thought I wouldn’t lay bare to you?
Yes, yes,
But if only you knew how wretched I am! I believe you, I
believe you.... What were you saying?
Well, well, what was it you were going to say about the prince? I have
driven away the fiend,
What did you begin to tell me about the prince?
Why did you find it so tiresome?
Oh, it was intolerable!
He does not improve on closer acquaintance. If
you want him defined, here he is: a prime, well-fed beast such as takes
medals at the cattle shows, and nothing more,
No; how so?
He’s seen a great deal, anyway; he’s
cultured?
It’s an utterly different culture—their culture. He’s cultivated, one
sees, simply to be able to despise culture, as they despise everything
but animal pleasures.
But don’t you all care for these animal pleasures?
How is it you’re defending him?
I’m not defending him, it’s nothing to me; but I imagine, if you had
not cared for those pleasures yourself, you might have got out of them.
But if it affords you satisfaction to gaze at Thérèse in the attire of
Eve....
Again, the devil again,
Yes; but I can’t help it. You don’t know what I have suffered waiting
for you. I believe I’m not jealous. I’m not jealous: I believe you when
you’re here; but when you’re away somewhere leading your life, so
incomprehensible to me....
How was it, then? Where did you meet Alexey Alexandrovitch?
We ran up against each other in the doorway.
And he bowed to you like this?
I don’t understand him in the least,
If after your
avowal to him at your country house he had broken with you, if he had
called me out—but this I can’t understand. How can he put up with such
a position? He feels it, that’s evident.
He?
He’s perfectly satisfied.
What are we all miserable for, when everything might be so happy?
Only not he. Don’t I know him, the falsity in which he’s utterly
steeped?... Could one, with any feeling, live as he is living with me?
He understands nothing, and feels nothing. Could a man of any feeling
live in the same house with his unfaithful wife? Could he talk to her,
call her ‘my dear’?
‘Anna, _ma chère_; Anna,
dear!’
He’s not a man, not a human being—he’s a doll! No one knows him; but I
know him. Oh, if I’d been in his place, I’d long ago have killed, have
torn to pieces a wife like me. I wouldn’t have said, ‘Anna, _ma
chère_’! He’s not a man, he’s an official machine. He doesn’t
understand that I’m your wife, that he’s outside, that he’s
superfluous.... Don’t let’s talk of him!...
You’re unfair, very unfair, dearest,
But never mind, don’t let’s talk of him. Tell me what you’ve been
doing? What is the matter? What has been wrong with you, and what did
the doctor say?
I imagine that it’s not illness, but your condition. When will it be?
Soon, soon. You say that our position is miserable, that we must put
an end to it. If you knew how terrible it is to me, what I would give
to be able to love you freely and boldly! I should not torture myself
and torture you with my jealousy.... And it will come soon, but not as
we expect.
It won’t come as we suppose. I didn’t mean to say this to you, but
you’ve made me. Soon, soon, all will be over, and we shall all, all be
at peace, and suffer no more.
I don’t understand,
You asked when? Soon. And I shan’t live through it. Don’t interrupt
me!
I know it; I know for certain. I
shall die; and I’m very glad I shall die, and release myself and you.
Yes, it’s better so,
That’s the
only way, the only way left us.
How absurd! What absurd nonsense you are talking!
No, it’s the truth.
What, what’s the truth?
That I shall die. I have had a dream.
A dream?
Yes, a dream,
It’s a long while since I dreamed it. I
dreamed that I ran into my bedroom, that I had to get something there,
to find out something; you know how it is in dreams,
and in the bedroom, in the corner, stood
something.
Oh, what nonsense! How can you believe....
And the something turned round, and I saw it was a peasant with a
disheveled beard, little, and dreadful looking. I wanted to run away,
but he bent down over a sack, and was fumbling there with his
hands....
He was fumbling and kept talking quickly, quickly in French, you know:
_Il faut le battre, le fer, le broyer, le pétrir_.... And in my horror
I tried to wake up, and woke up ... but woke up in the dream. And I
began asking myself what it meant. And Korney said to me: ‘In
childbirth you’ll die, ma’am, you’ll die....’ And I woke up.
What nonsense, what nonsense!
But don’t let’s talk of it. Ring the bell, I’ll have tea. And stay a
little now; it’s not long I shall....
What do you want?
Your lover’s letters,
They’re not here,
Sit down! I have to speak to you,
I told you that I would not allow you to receive your lover in this
house.
I had to see him to....
I do not enter into the details of why a woman wants to see her
lover.
I meant, I only....
Surely you must feel how easy it is
for you to insult me?
An honest man and an honest woman may be insulted, but to tell a thief
he’s a thief is simply _la constatation d’un fait_.
This cruelty is something new I did not know in you.
You call it cruelty for a husband to give his wife liberty, giving her
the honorable protection of his name, simply on the condition of
observing the proprieties: is that cruelty?
It’s worse than cruel—it’s base, if you want to know!
No!
Base! If you care to use that word, what is base is to forsake husband
and child for a lover, while you eat your husband’s bread!
You cannot describe my position as worse than I feel it to be myself;
but what are you saying all this for?
What am I saying it for? what for?
That you
may know that since you have not carried out my wishes in regard to
observing outward decorum, I will take measures to put an end to this
state of things.
Soon, very soon, it will end, anyway,
It will end sooner than you and your lover have planned! If you must
have the satisfaction of animal passion....
Alexey Alexandrovitch! I won’t say it’s not generous, but it’s not
like a gentleman to strike anyone who’s down.
Yes, you only think of yourself! But the sufferings of a man who was
your husband have no interest for you. You don’t care that his whole
life is ruined, that he is thuff ... thuff....
suffering.
thuffering.
I came to tell you....
No, it was my fancy,
suffering.
No;
can a man with those dull eyes, with that self-satisfied complacency,
feel anything?
I cannot change anything,
I have come to tell you that I am going tomorrow to Moscow, and shall
not return again to this house, and you will receive notice of what I
decide through the lawyer into whose hands I shall intrust the task of
getting a divorce. My son is going to my sister’s,
You take Seryozha to hurt me,
You do not love him.... Leave me Seryozha!
Yes, I have lost even my affection for my son, because he is
associated with the repulsion I feel for you. But still I shall take
him. Good-bye!
Alexey Alexandrovitch, leave me Seryozha!
I
have nothing else to say. Leave Seryozha till my ... I shall soon be
confined; leave him!
What are you wanting?
He is engaged,
Can’t he spare time to see me?
He has no time free; he is always busy. Kindly wait your turn.
Then I must trouble you to give him my card,
Coming immediately,
Pray walk in,
Won’t you sit down?
Before beginning to speak of my business,
I ought to
observe that the business about which I have to speak to you is to be
strictly private.
I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets confided to
me. But if you would like proof....
You know my name?
I know you and the good
work you are doing,
like every Russian,
I have the misfortune,
to have been
deceived in my married life, and I desire to break off all relations
with my wife by legal means—that is, to be divorced, but to do this so
that my son may not remain with his mother.
You desire my assistance in securing a divorce?
Yes, precisely so; but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your
time and attention. I have come simply to consult you as a preliminary
step. I want a divorce, but the form in which it is possible is of
great consequence to me. It is very possible that if that form does not
correspond with my requirements I may give up a legal divorce.
Oh, that’s always the case,
and that’s always for
you to decide.
Though in their general features our laws on this subject are known to
me,
I should be glad to have an idea
of the forms in which such things are done in practice.
You would be glad,
for me to lay before you all the methods by which you could
secure what you desire?
Divorce by our laws,
is possible, as you are aware, in the following cases....
Wait a little!
... In the following cases: physical defect in the married
parties, desertion without communication for five years,
adultery
subdivided as follows
physical
defect of the husband or of the wife, adultery of the husband or of the
wife.
This is the theoretical view; but I imagine you
have done me the honor to apply to me in order to learn its application
in practice. And therefore, guided by precedents, I must inform you
that in practice cases of divorce may all be reduced to the
following—there’s no physical defect, I may assume, nor desertion?...
—May be reduced to the following: adultery of one of the married
parties, and the detection in the fact of the guilty party by mutual
agreement, and failing such agreement, accidental detection. It must be
admitted that the latter case is rarely met with in practice,
The most usual and simple,
the sensible course, I consider, is adultery by mutual consent. I
should not permit myself to express it so, speaking with a man of no
education,
but I imagine that to you this is
comprehensible.
People cannot go on living together—here you have a fact. And if both
are agreed about it, the details and formalities become a matter of no
importance. And at the same time this is the simplest and most certain
method.
That is out of the question in the present case,
Only one
alternative is possible: undesigned detection, supported by letters
which I have.
Kindly consider,
cases of that kind are, as you are aware,
under ecclesiastical jurisdiction; the reverend fathers are fond of
going into the minutest details in cases of that kind,
Letters may, of course, be a partial confirmation; but detection in
the fact there must be of the most direct kind, that is, by
eyewitnesses. In fact, if you do me the honor to intrust your
confidence to me, you will do well to leave me the choice of the
measures to be employed. If one wants the result, one must admit the
means.
If it is so....
Tell her we don’t haggle over fees!
Nice state my rep
curtains will be in by the summer!
And so you were saying?...
I will communicate my decision to you by letter,
From your words I may
consequently conclude that a divorce may be obtained? I would ask you
to let me know what are your terms.
It may be obtained if you give me complete liberty of action,
When can I reckon on receiving
information from you?
In a week’s time. Your answer as to whether you will undertake to
conduct the case, and on what terms, you will be so good as to
communicate to me.
Very good.
I think it very noble,
Why take money for posting-horses when everyone knows that there are
railways everywhere now?
It’s all very well for you to talk,
when you have I don’t
know how many millions; but I am very glad when my husband goes on a
revising tour in the summer. It’s very good for him and pleasant
traveling about, and it’s a settled arrangement for me to keep a
carriage and coachman on the money.
Well, what a shame not to have let us know! Been here long? I was at
Dussots’ yesterday and saw ‘Karenin’ on the visitors’ list, but it
never entered my head that it was you,
or I should have
looked you up. I am glad to see you!
What a shame of you not to
let us know!
I had no time; I am very busy,
Come to my wife, she does so want to see you.
Why, Alexey Alexandrovitch, what are you cutting us like this for?
I was very busy. Delighted to see you!
How are you?
Tell me, how is my darling Anna?
I tell you what we’ll do tomorrow. Dolly, ask him to dinner. We’ll ask
Koznishev and Pestsov, so as to entertain him with our Moscow
celebrities.
Yes, please, do come,
we will expect you at five, or six
o’clock, if you like. How is my darling Anna? How long....
She is quite well,
Delighted!
You will come?
I shall come round tomorrow!
Queer fish!
Stiva! Stiva!
I must get coats, you know, for Grisha and Tanya. Give me the money.
Never mind; you tell them I’ll pay the bill!
They’re all people, all men, like us poor sinners; why be nasty
and quarrelsome?
Good-day, Vassily,
why, you’ve let
your whiskers grow! Levin, number seven, eh? Take me up, please. And
find out whether Count Anitchkin
is
receiving.
Yes, sir,
You’ve not been to see us for
a long while.
I was here yesterday, but at the other entrance. Is this number
seven?
What! you killed him?
Well done! A
she-bear? How are you, Arhip!
Come, take off your coat and stay a little,
No, I haven’t time; I’ve only looked in for a tiny second,
Come, tell me, please, what you did abroad? Where have you been?
Oh, I stayed in Germany, in Prussia, in France, and in England—not in
the capitals, but in the manufacturing towns, and saw a great deal that
was new to me. And I’m glad I went.
Yes, I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question.
Not a bit: in Russia there can be no labor question. In Russia the
question is that of the relation of the working people to the land;
though the question exists there too—but there it’s a matter of
repairing what’s been ruined, while with us....
Yes, yes!
it’s very possible you’re right. But I’m glad
you’re in good spirits, and are hunting bears, and working, and
interested. Shtcherbatsky told me another story—he met you—that you
were in such a depressed state, talking of nothing but death....
Well, what of it? I’ve not given up thinking of death,
It’s true that it’s high time I was dead; and that all this is
nonsense. It’s the truth I’m telling you. I do value my idea and my
work awfully; but in reality only consider this: all this world of ours
is nothing but a speck of mildew, which has grown up on a tiny planet.
And for us to suppose we can have something great—ideas, work—it’s all
dust and ashes.
But all that’s as old as the hills, my boy!
It is old; but do you know, when you grasp this fully, then somehow
everything becomes of no consequence. When you understand that you will
die tomorrow, if not today, and nothing will be left, then everything
is so unimportant! And I consider my idea very important, but it turns
out really to be as unimportant too, even if it were carried out, as
doing for that bear. So one goes on living, amusing oneself with
hunting, with work—anything so as not to think of death!
Well, of course! Here you’ve come round to my point. Do you remember
you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life? Don’t be so severe, O
moralist!
No; all the same, what’s fine in life is....
oh, I
don’t know. All I know is that we shall soon be dead.
Why so soon?
And do you know, there’s less charm in life, when one thinks of death,
but there’s more peace.
On the contrary, the finish is always the best. But I must be going,
Oh, no, stay a bit!
Now, when shall we see
each other again? I’m going tomorrow.
I’m a nice person! Why, that’s just what I came for! You simply must
come to dinner with us today. Your brother’s coming, and Karenin, my
brother-in-law.
You don’t mean to say he’s here?
Whether she’s coming or not, I don’t care,
So you’ll come?
Of course.
At five o’clock, then, and not evening dress.
No matter,
so much the better. I will
inform him at once of my position in regard to his sister, and explain
why it is I can’t dine with him.
Come in!
There, you see, you’re talking nonsense, and he’s at home!
Well, I’m awfully glad I’ve found you! So I hope....
I cannot come,
Why can’t you? What do you mean?
Oh, but it’s a promise. And we’re all counting on you.
I want to tell you that I can’t dine at your house, because the terms
of relationship which have existed between us must cease.
How? How do you mean? What for?
Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister, my
wife. I ought to have....
No, Alexey Alexandrovitch! What are you saying?
It is so.
Excuse me, I can’t, I can’t believe it!
Yes, I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce,
I will say one thing, Alexey Alexandrovitch. I know you for an
excellent, upright man; I know Anna—excuse me, I can’t change my
opinion of her—for a good, an excellent woman; and so, excuse me, I
cannot believe it. There is some misunderstanding,
Oh, if it were merely a misunderstanding!...
Pardon, I understand,
But of
course.... One thing: you must not act in haste. You must not, you must
not act in haste!
I am not acting in haste,
but one
cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter. I have quite made up my
mind.
This is awful!
I would do one thing,
Alexey Alexandrovitch. I beseech you, do it!
No action has
yet been taken, if I understand rightly. Before you take advice, see my
wife, talk to her. She loves Anna like a sister, she loves you, and
she’s a wonderful woman. For God’s sake, talk to her! Do me that favor,
I beseech you!
You will go to see her?
I don’t know. That was just why I have not been to see you. I imagine
our relations must change.
Why so? I don’t see that. Allow me to believe that apart from our
connection you have for me, at least in part, the same friendly feeling
I have always had for you ... and sincere esteem,
Even if your worst suppositions were
correct, I don’t—and never would—take on myself to judge either side,
and I see no reason why our relations should be affected. But now, do
this, come and see my wife.
Well, we look at the matter differently,
However, we won’t discuss it.
No; why shouldn’t you come today to dine, anyway? My wife’s expecting
you. Please, do come. And, above all, talk it over with her. She’s a
wonderful woman. For God’s sake, on my knees, I implore you!
If you so much wish it, I will come,
Well, have you seen him?
Of course; he was at our sitting yesterday. He seems to know his work
capitally, and to be very energetic.
Yes, but what is his energy directed to?
Is he aiming at doing anything, or simply undoing what’s been done?
It’s the great misfortune of our government—this paper administration,
of which he’s a worthy representative.
Really, I don’t know what fault one could find with him. His policy I
don’t know, but one thing—he’s a very nice fellow,
I’ve just been seeing him, and he’s really a capital
fellow. We lunched together, and I taught him how to make, you know
that drink, wine and oranges. It’s so cooling. And it’s a wonder he
didn’t know it. He liked it awfully. No, really he’s a capital fellow.
Why, good heavens, it’s four already, and I’ve still to go to
Dolgovushin’s! So please come round to dinner. You can’t imagine how
you will grieve my wife and me.
I’ve promised, and I’ll come,
Believe me, I appreciate it, and I hope you won’t regret it,
At five o’clock, and not evening dress, please,
Well, old
boy, you have popped me down in a learned set! A drinking party now, or
the _Château des Fleurs_, would be more in my line!
I’m not late?
You can never help being late!
Have you a lot of people? Who’s here?
All our own set. Kitty’s here. Come along, I’ll introduce you to
Karenin.
What is she like, what is she like? Like what she used to be, or like
what she was in the carriage? What if Darya Alexandrovna told the
truth? Why shouldn’t it be the truth?
Oh, please, introduce me to Karenin,
How long it is since we’ve seen each other!
You’ve not seen me, but I’ve seen you,
I saw you when you were driving from the railway
station to Ergushovo.
When?
You were driving to Ergushovo,
And how dared I
associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching
creature? And, yes, I do believe it’s true what Darya Alexandrovna told
me,
Let me introduce you.
Very glad to meet you again,
You are acquainted?
We spent three hours together in the train,
but
got out, just as in a masquerade, quite mystified—at least I was.
Nonsense! Come along, please,
So, then, for the Russification of our foreign populations there is
but one method—to bring up as many children as one can. My brother and
I are terribly in fault, I see. You married men, especially you, Stepan
Arkadyevitch, are the real patriots: what number have you reached?
Oh, yes, that’s the best method!
This cheese is not bad. Shall I give you some?
Why, have you been going in for gymnastics again?
What biceps! A perfect Samson!
I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears,
Not at all. Quite the contrary; a child can kill a bear,
You have killed a bear, I’ve been told!
Are there
bears on your place?
No, we’ve been hunting in the Tver province. It was coming back from
there that I met your _beau-frère_ in the train, or your _beau-frère’s_
brother-in-law,
It was an amusing meeting.
The conductor, forgetting the proverb, would have chucked me out on
account of my attire; but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in
elevated language, and ... you, too,
at first would have ejected me on the ground of
the old coat, but afterwards you took my part, for which I am extremely
grateful.
The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too
ill-defined,
I saw you were in uncertainty about me,
but I made haste to plunge into intellectual
conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.
What is the matter
with him today? Why such a conquering hero?
Oh, you may as well sit there,
I did not mean,
mere density of population alone, but in conjunction
with fundamental ideas, and not by means of principles.
It seems to me,
that that’s the same thing. In my opinion, influence over
another people is only possible to the people which has the higher
development, which....
But that’s just the question,
In what are we to make higher development
consist? The English, the French, the Germans, which is at the highest
stage of development? Which of them will nationalize the other? We see
the Rhine provinces have been turned French, but the Germans are not at
a lower stage!
There is another law at work there.
I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true
civilization,
But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true
civilization?
I imagine such signs are generally very well known,
But are they fully known?
It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely
classical; but we see most intense disputes on each side of the
question, and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong
points in its favor.
You are for classics, Sergey Ivanovitch. Will you take red wine?
I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture,
I only say that both sides have strong arguments to
support them,
My
sympathies are classical from education, but in this discussion I am
personally unable to arrive at a conclusion. I see no distinct grounds
for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific
studies.
The natural sciences have just as great an educational value,
Take astronomy, take botany, or zoology with its system of
general principles.
I cannot quite agree with that,
It
seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the
forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual
development. Moreover, it cannot be denied that the influence of the
classical authors is in the highest degree moral, while, unfortunately,
with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and
noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day.
But,
One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of
classical and scientific studies is a difficult task, and the question
which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so
quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of
classical education, as you expressed it just now, its moral—_disons le
mot_—anti-nihilist influence.
Undoubtedly.
If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti-nihilistic
influence on the side of classical studies, we should have considered
the subject more, have weighed the arguments on both sides,
we should have given elbow-room
to both tendencies. But now we know that these little pills of
classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti-nihilism, and
we boldly prescribe them to our patients.... But what if they had no
such medicinal property?
I can’t agree even,
that the government had that aim. The
government obviously is guided by abstract considerations, and remains
indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise. The education
of women, for instance, would naturally be regarded as likely to be
harmful, but the government opens schools and universities for women.
I consider, on the contrary, that the two questions are inseparably
connected together,
it is a vicious circle. Woman is
deprived of rights from lack of education, and the lack of education
results from the absence of rights. We must not forget that the
subjection of women is so complete, and dates from such ages back that
we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from
us,
You said rights,
meaning the right of sitting on juries, of voting, of
presiding at official meetings, the right of entering the civil
service, of sitting in parliament....
Undoubtedly.
But if women, as a rare exception, can occupy such positions, it seems
to me you are wrong in using the expression ‘rights.’ It would be more
correct to say duties. Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a
juryman, a witness, a telegraph clerk, we feel we are performing
duties. And therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking
duties, and quite legitimately. And one can but sympathize with this
desire to assist in the general labor of man.
Quite so,
The question, I imagine,
is simply whether they are fitted for such duties.
They will most likely be perfectly fitted,
when education has become general among them. We see this....
How about the proverb?
I can
say it before my daughter: her hair is long, because her wit is....
Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation!
What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties,
while we see, unhappily, that men usually try to
avoid them.
Duties are bound up with rights—power, money, honor; those are what
women are seeking,
Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet-nurse and feel
injured because women are paid for the work, while no one will take
me,
Yes, but a man can’t nurse a baby,
while a woman....
No, there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship,
There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials,
Yes, but what is a girl to do who has no family?
If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted, you would find she
had abandoned a family—her own or a sister’s, where she might have
found a woman’s duties,
But we take our stand on principle as the ideal,
Woman desires to have rights, to be independent,
educated. She is oppressed, humiliated by the consciousness of her
disabilities.
And I’m oppressed and humiliated that they won’t engage me at the
Foundling,
It was very, very early in the morning. You were probably only just
awake. Your mother was asleep in the corner. It was an exquisite
morning. I was walking along wondering who it could be in a
four-in-hand? It was a splendid set of four horses with bells, and in a
second you flashed by, and I saw you at the window—you were sitting
like this, holding the strings of your cap in both hands, and thinking
awfully deeply about something,
How I should like
to know what you were thinking about then! Something important?
Wasn’t I dreadfully untidy?
Really I don’t remember.
How nicely Turovtsin laughs!
Have you known him long?
Oh, everyone knows him!
And I see you think he’s a horrid man?
Not horrid, but nothing in him.
Oh, you’re wrong! And you must give up thinking so directly!
I used to have a very poor opinion of him too, but he, he’s an
awfully nice and wonderfully good-hearted man. He has a heart of gold.
How could you find out what sort of heart he has?
We are great friends. I know him very well. Last winter, soon after
... you came to see us,
all Dolly’s children had scarlet fever, and he
happened to come and see her. And only fancy,
he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look
after the children. Yes, and for three weeks he stopped with them, and
looked after the children like a nurse.
I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the scarlet
fever,
Yes, it was wonderful, noble!
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, and I’ll never think ill of people again!
No, I don’t smoke,
I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of
things,
You heard, perhaps, about Pryatchnikov?
Vasya Pryatchnikov,
they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver, and has
killed him.
What did Pryatchnikov fight about?
His wife. Acted like a man, he did! Called him out and shot him!
Ah!
How glad I am you have come,
I must talk to you. Let’s sit
here.
It’s fortunate,
especially as I was meaning to ask you to
excuse me, and to be taking leave. I have to start tomorrow.
Alexey Alexandrovitch,
I asked you about Anna, you made me no answer. How is
she?
She is, I believe, quite well, Darya Alexandrovna,
Alexey Alexandrovitch, forgive me, I have no right ... but I love Anna
as a sister, and esteem her; I beg, I beseech you to tell me what is
wrong between you? what fault do you find with her?
I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I
consider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna?
I don’t believe it, I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!
We
shall be disturbed here. Come this way, please.
I don’t, I don’t believe it!
One cannot disbelieve facts, Darya Alexandrovna,
facts.
But what has she done?
What precisely has
she done?
She has forsaken her duty, and deceived her husband. That’s what she
has done,
No, no, it can’t be! No, for God’s sake, you are mistaken,
It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs
her husband of the fact—informs him that eight years of her life, and a
son, all that’s a mistake, and that she wants to begin life again,
Anna and sin—I cannot connect them, I cannot believe it!
Darya Alexandrovna,
I would give a great deal for doubt to be still
possible. When I doubted, I was miserable, but it was better than now.
When I doubted, I had hope; but now there is no hope, and still I doubt
of everything. I am in such doubt of everything that I even hate my
son, and sometimes do not believe he is my son. I am very unhappy.
Oh, this is awful, awful! But can it be true that you are resolved on
a divorce?
I am resolved on extreme measures. There is nothing else for me to
do.
Nothing else to do, nothing else to do....
Oh no, don’t say nothing else to do!
What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot, as in
any other—in loss, in death—bear one’s trouble in peace, but that one
must act,
One must get out
of the humiliating position in which one is placed; one can’t live _à
trois_.
I understand, I quite understand that,
But wait a
little! You are a Christian. Think of her! What will become of her, if
you cast her off?
I have thought, Darya Alexandrovna, I have thought a great deal,
That was what I did indeed when she herself
made known to me my humiliation; I left everything as of old. I gave
her a chance to reform, I tried to save her. And with what result? She
would not regard the slightest request—that she should observe
decorum,
One may save anyone who does not
want to be ruined; but if the whole nature is so corrupt, so depraved,
that ruin itself seems to be her salvation, what’s to be done?
Anything, only not divorce!
But what is anything?
No, it is awful! She will be no one’s wife, she will be lost!
What can I do?
I am very grateful for your sympathy, but I must be going,
No, wait a minute. You must not ruin her. Wait a little; I will tell
you about myself. I was married, and my husband deceived me; in anger
and jealousy, I would have thrown up everything, I would myself.... But
I came to myself again; and who did it? Anna saved me. And here I am
living on. The children are growing up, my husband has come back to his
family, and feels his fault, is growing purer, better, and I live
on.... I have forgiven it, and you ought to forgive!
Forgive I cannot, and do not wish to, and I regard it as wrong. I have
done everything for this woman, and she has trodden it all in the mud
to which she is akin. I am not a spiteful man, I have never hated
anyone, but I hate her with my whole soul, and I cannot even forgive
her, because I hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me!
Love those that hate you....
Love those that hate you, but to love those one hates is impossible.
Forgive me for having troubled you. Everyone has enough to bear in his
own grief!
choral
I thought you were going towards the piano,
That’s something I miss in the country—music.
No; we only came to fetch you and thank you,
for coming. What do they want to
argue for? No one ever convinces anyone, you know.
Yes; that’s true,
it generally happens that one argues
warmly simply because one can’t make out what one’s opponent wants to
prove.
I know: one must find out what he is arguing for, what is precious to
him, then one can....
No,
a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live
in the family without humiliation, while she herself....
Oh, yes,
Yes, yes, yes—you’re right; you’re right!
Ah! I’ve scribbled all over the table!
What! shall I be left alone—without her?
Wait a minute,
I’ve long wanted to ask you one thing.
Please, ask it.
Here,
When you told me it
could never be, did that mean never, or then?
Is it what I think?
I understand,
What is this word?
It means _never_,
but that’s not true!
Then I could not answer differently.
Only then?
Yes,
And n... and now?
Well, read this. I’ll tell you what I should like—should like so
much!
If you could forget and forgive what happened.
I have nothing to
forget and to forgive; I have never ceased to love you.
I understand,
Is it this?
Yes.
You’re playing _secrétaire_?
But we must really
be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater.
Oh, so it’s not time to die yet?
N-n-no!
How glad I am you have met Kitty again! One
must value old friends.
Where are you going?
I’m going to a meeting.
Well, I’ll come with you. May I?
What for? Yes, come along,
What is
the matter with you today?
With me? Happiness is the matter with me!
You don’t mind?—it’s
so stifling. It’s happiness is the matter with me! Why is it you have
never married?
I am very glad, she seems a nice gi....
Don’t say it! don’t say it!
She’s a nice
girl
Well, anyway, I may say that I’m very glad of it.
That you may do tomorrow, tomorrow and nothing more! Nothing, nothing,
silence,
I do like you so! Well, is it possible for me to be present at
the meeting?
Of course it is.
What is your discussion about today?
Well, did you like it?
Very much. I never supposed it was so interesting! Capital! Splendid!
Most delighted,
Well, Yegor, it’s hard work not sleeping, isn’t it?
One’s got to put up with it! It’s part of our work, you see. In a
gentleman’s house it’s easier; but then here one makes more.
Wonderfully good-hearted fellow!
Well, but you yourself, Yegor, when you got married, did you love your
wife?
Ay! and why not?
My life, too, has been a wonderful one. From a child up....
Poor, unlucky fellow!
Wo!
Well, it’s a long while since you’ve been to see us, Konstantin
Dmitrievitch!
Are they up?
Pray walk in! Leave it here,
To whom shall I announce your honor?
The princess ... the prince ... the young princess....
Let us go to mamma!
Can it be true?
I can’t believe
you love me, dear!
dear,
Yes!
I am so happy!
So it is all settled! I am glad. Love her. I am glad.... Kitty!
You’ve not been long settling things,
I’ve long, always wished for this!
Even when this little
feather-head fancied....
Papa!
Well, I won’t!
I’m very, very ... plea... Oh, what a fool I
am....
When is it to be? We must have the benediction and announcement. And
when’s the wedding to be? What do you think, Alexander?
Here he is,
he’s the
principal person in the matter.
When?
Tomorrow. If you ask me, I should say,
the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow.
Come, _mon cher_, that’s nonsense!
Well, in a week.
He’s quite mad.
No, why so?
Well, upon my word!
How about the trousseau?
Will there really be a trousseau and all that?
But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that—can it
spoil my happiness? Nothing can spoil it!
Then it must be all right,
Oh, I know nothing about it; I only said what I should like,
We’ll talk it over, then. The benediction and announcement can take
place now. That’s very well.
How I knew it would be so! I never hoped for it; and yet in my heart I
was always sure,
I believe that it was ordained.
And I!
Even when....
Even when I thrust
from me my happiness. I always loved you alone, but I was carried away.
I ought to tell you.... Can you forgive that?
Perhaps it was for the best. You will have to forgive me so much. I
ought to tell you....
No, not now, later!
Very well, later, but you must certainly tell me. I’m not afraid of
anything. I want to know everything. Now it is settled.
Settled that you’ll take me whatever I may be—you won’t give
me up? Yes?
Yes, yes.
Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat,
Well, I’m very glad,
I advise you to get the
bouquets from Fomin’s.
Oh, are they wanted?
Oh, are presents wanted?
Take them, take these dreadful books!
Why did you give them me? No,
it was better anyway,
But
it’s awful, awful!
You can’t forgive me,
Yes, I forgive you; but it’s terrible!
_Acted like a man, he did! Called him out and shot him!_
But the matter is settled, it’s useless thinking about it,
Two telegrams,
I beg your
pardon, your excellency; I’d only just that minute gone out.
_Quos vult perdere dementat_,
Something else in the same line,
Anna,
I am
dying; I beg, I implore you to come. I shall die easier with your
forgiveness,
There is no deceit she would stick at. She was near her confinement.
Perhaps it is the confinement. But what can be their aim? To legitimize
the child, to compromise me, and prevent a divorce,
But
something was said in it: I am dying....
And if it is true?
If it is true that in the
moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent, and I,
taking it for a trick, refuse to go? That would not only be cruel, and
everyone would blame me, but it would be stupid on my part.
Piotr, call a coach; I am going to Petersburg,
If it’s a trick, then calm contempt and departure. If
truth, do what is proper.
How is your mistress?
A successful confinement yesterday.
And how is she?
Very ill,
There was a consultation yesterday, and the
doctor’s here now.
Take my things,
Who is here?
The doctor, the midwife, and Count Vronsky.
Thank God you’ve come! She keeps on about you and nothing but you,
Make haste with the ice!
She is dying. The doctors say there is no hope. I am entirely in your
power, only let me be here ... though I am at your disposal. I....
For Alexey—I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch (what a strange and
awful thing that both are Alexey, isn’t it?)—Alexey would not refuse
me. I should forget, he would forgive.... But why doesn’t he come? He’s
so good he doesn’t know himself how good he is. Ah, my God, what agony!
Give me some water, quick! Oh, that will be bad for her, my little
girl! Oh, very well then, give her to a nurse. Yes, I agree, it’s
better in fact. He’ll be coming; it will hurt him to see her. Give her
to the nurse.
Anna Arkadyevna, he has come. Here he is!
Oh, what nonsense!
No, give
her to me; give me my little one! He has not come yet. You say he won’t
forgive me, because you don’t know him. No one knows him. I’m the only
one, and it was hard for me even. His eyes I ought to know—Seryozha has
just the same eyes—and I can’t bear to see them because of it. Has
Seryozha had his dinner? I know everyone will forget him. He would not
forget. Seryozha must be moved into the corner room, and Mariette must
be asked to sleep with him.
No, no!
I am not afraid of him; I am afraid of death.
Alexey, come here. I am in a hurry, because I’ve no time, I’ve not long
left to live; the fever will begin directly and I shall understand
nothing more. Now I understand, I understand it all, I see it all!
Wait a minute, you don’t know ... stay a little, stay!...
Yes,
yes, yes,
yes. This is what I wanted to say. Don’t be surprised at me. I’m still
the same.... But there is another woman in me, I’m afraid of her: she
loved that man, and I tried to hate you, and could not forget about her
that used to be. I’m not that woman. Now I’m my real self, all myself.
I’m dying now, I know I shall die, ask him. Even now I feel—see here,
the weights on my feet, on my hands, on my fingers. My fingers—see how
huge they are! But this will soon all be over.... Only one thing I
want: forgive me, forgive me quite. I’m terrible, but my nurse used to
tell me; the holy martyr—what was her name? She was worse. And I’ll go
to Rome; there’s a wilderness, and there I shall be no trouble to
anyone, only I’ll take Seryozha and the little one.... No, you can’t
forgive me! I know, it can’t be forgiven! No, no, go away, you’re too
good!
That is he. I knew him! Now, forgive me, everyone, forgive me!...
They’ve come again; why don’t they go away?... Oh, take these cloaks
off me!
Remember one thing, that I needed nothing but forgiveness, and I want
nothing more.... Why doesn’t _he_ come?
Do come, do come! Give him your hand.
Uncover your face—look at him! He’s a saint,
Oh! uncover
your face, do uncover it!
Alexey Alexandrovitch, do
uncover his face! I want to see him.
Give him your hand. Forgive him.
Thank God, thank God!
now everything is ready. Only to
stretch my legs a little. There, that’s capital. How badly these
flowers are done—not a bit like a violet,
My God, my God! when will it end? Give me some morphine.
Doctor, give me some morphine! Oh, my God, my God!
Better stay, she
might ask for you,
Alexey Alexandrovitch,
I can’t speak, I can’t understand. Spare me!
However hard it is for you, believe me, it is more terrible for me.
I beg you to hear me out; it is necessary. I must explain my feelings,
the feelings that have guided me and will guide me, so that you may not
be in error regarding me. You know I had resolved on a divorce, and had
even begun to take proceedings. I won’t conceal from you that in
beginning this I was in uncertainty, I was in misery; I will confess
that I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her.
When I got the telegram, I came here with the same feelings; I will say
more, I longed for her death. But....
But I saw her and
forgave her. And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my
duty. I forgive completely. I would offer the other cheek, I would give
my cloak if my coat be taken. I pray to God only not to take from me
the bliss of forgiveness!
This is my position: you can trample me in the mud, make me the
laughing-stock of the world, I will not abandon her, and I will never
utter a word of reproach to you,
My
duty is clearly marked for me; I ought to be with her, and I will be.
If she wishes to see you, I will let you know, but now I suppose it
would be better for you to go away.
A sledge, sir?
Yes, a sledge.
To sleep! To forget!
You may trample me in the mud,
To sleep! To forget!
That is not and will not be, and she wants to wipe it out of her
memory. But I cannot live without it. How can we be reconciled? how can
we be reconciled?
Take away his hands,
I did
not appreciate it, did not make enough of it. I did not appreciate it,
did not make enough of it.
What’s this? Am I going out of my mind?
Perhaps.
What makes men go out of their minds; what makes men shoot themselves?
No, I must sleep!
That’s all over for me,
I must think what to do. What is left?
Ambition? Serpuhovskoy? Society? The court?
This is how people go mad,
and how
they shoot themselves ... to escape humiliation,
Of course,
of course,
Of course,
Idiotic! Missed!
Who is here?
Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya,
The doctor said it was nothing serious, and he ordered a bath, sir.
But she is still in pain,
I think it’s the wet-nurse, sir,
What makes you think so?
It’s just as it was at Countess Paul’s, sir. They gave the baby
medicine, and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry: the nurse
had no milk, sir.
Still no better?
She’s very restless,
Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet-nurse has no milk,
I think so too, Alexey Alexandrovitch.
Then why didn’t you say so?
Who’s one to say it to? Anna Arkadyevna still ill....
You must ask the doctor to examine the wet-nurse,
Luckless child!
If he hadn’t been going away, I could have understood your answer and
his too. But your husband ought to be above that,
It’s not for my husband; for myself I don’t wish it. Don’t say that!
Yes, but you must care to say good-bye to a man who has shot himself
on your account....
That’s just why I don’t want to.
Ah!
I’m very glad you’re at home. You
never put in an appearance anywhere, and I haven’t seen you ever since
Anna has been ill. I have heard all about it—your anxiety. Yes, you’re
a wonderful husband!
Better, I think,
But you’ve rather a feverish-looking color,
feverish.
We’ve been talking too much,
I feel it’s selfishness on
my part, and I am going away.
No, wait a minute, please. I must tell you ... no, you.
I won’t and can’t keep anything secret from you,
Betsy’s been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say
good-bye before his departure for Tashkend.
I told her I could not receive him.
You said, my dear, that it would depend on Alexey Alexandrovitch,
Oh, no, I can’t receive him; and what object would there....
In short, I don’t wish it....
I am very grateful to you for your confidence, but....
Well, good-bye, my darling,
Alexey Alexandrovitch! I know you are a truly magnanimous man,
I am an outsider, but I so love her
and respect you that I venture to advise. Receive him. Alexey Vronsky
is the soul of honor, and he is going away to Tashkend.
Thank you, princess, for your sympathy and advice. But the question of
whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself.
I am very grateful for your confidence in me.
thou
And I am very grateful for your decision. I, too, imagine that
since he is going away, there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky
to come here. However, if....
But I’ve said so already, so why repeat it?
No sort of
necessity,
for a man to come and say good-bye to the
woman he loves, for whom he was ready to ruin himself, and has ruined
himself, and who cannot live without him. No sort of necessity!
Let us never speak of it,
I have left this question to you to decide, and I am very glad to
see....
That my wish coincides with your own,
Yes,
and Princess Tverskaya’s interference in the most
difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for. She especially....
I don’t believe a word of what’s said about her,
I know she really cares for me.
I have just sent for the doctor,
I am very well; what do I want the doctor for?
No, the little one cries, and they say the nurse hasn’t enough milk.
Why didn’t you let me nurse her, when I begged to? Anyway
anyway
she’s a baby,
and they’re killing her.
I begged to nurse her, I wasn’t allowed to, and now I’m
blamed for it.
I don’t blame....
Yes, you do blame me! My God! why didn’t I die!
Forgive me, I’m nervous, I’m unjust,
but do go away....
No, it can’t go on like this,
Ah! princess! what a delightful meeting!
I’ve been to see
you.
A meeting for one minute, for I’m going,
Don’t put on your glove yet, princess; let me kiss your hand. There’s
nothing I’m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the
kissing the hand.
When shall we see each
other?
You don’t deserve it,
Oh, yes, I deserve a great deal, for I’ve become a most serious
person. I don’t only manage my own affairs, but other people’s too,
Oh, I’m so glad!
He’s killing her,
It’s impossible, impossible....
I’m so glad you think so,
that’s what
I’ve come to Petersburg for.
The whole town’s talking of it,
It’s an impossible
position. She pines and pines away. He doesn’t understand that she’s
one of those women who can’t trifle with their feelings. One of two
things: either let him take her away, act with energy, or give her a
divorce. This is stifling her.
Yes, yes ... just so....
That’s what I’ve
come for. At least not solely for that ... I’ve been made a
_Kammerherr_; of course, one has to say thank you. But the chief thing
was having to settle this.
Well, God help you!
Very, very miserably. Today and this morning and all past days and
days to come,
I think you’re giving way to pessimism. You must rouse yourself, you
must look life in the face. I know it’s hard, but....
I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices,
but I hate him for his virtues. I can’t live with him.
Do you understand? the sight of him has a physical effect on me, it
makes me beside myself. I can’t, I can’t live with him. What am I to
do? I have been unhappy, and used to think one couldn’t be more
unhappy, but the awful state of things I am going through now, I could
never have conceived. Would you believe it, that knowing he’s a good
man, a splendid man, that I’m not worth his little finger, still I hate
him. I hate him for his generosity. And there’s nothing left for me
but....
You are ill and overwrought,
believe me, you’re
exaggerating dreadfully. There’s nothing so terrible in it.
No, Stiva,
I’m lost, lost! worse than lost! I can’t say
yet that all is over; on the contrary, I feel that it’s not over. I’m
an overstrained string that must snap. But it’s not ended yet ... and
it will have a fearful end.
No matter, we must let the string be loosened, little by little.
There’s no position from which there is no way of escape.
I have thought, and thought. Only one....
Not at all,
Listen to me. You can’t see your own position
as I can. Let me tell you candidly my opinion.
I’ll begin from the beginning. You
married a man twenty years older than yourself. You married him without
love and not knowing what love was. It was a mistake, let’s admit.
A fearful mistake!
But I repeat, it’s an accomplished fact. Then you had, let us say, the
misfortune to love a man not your husband. That was a misfortune; but
that, too, is an accomplished fact. And your husband knew it and
forgave it.
That’s so. Now the question is: can you go on
living with your husband? Do you wish it? Does he wish it?
I know nothing, nothing.
But you said yourself that you can’t endure him.
No, I didn’t say so. I deny it. I can’t tell, I don’t know anything
about it.
Yes, but let....
You can’t understand. I feel I’m lying head downwards in a sort of
pit, but I ought not to save myself. And I can’t....
Never mind, we’ll slip something under and pull you out. I understand
you: I understand that you can’t take it on yourself to express your
wishes, your feelings.
There’s nothing, nothing I wish ... except for it to be all over.
But he sees this and knows it. And do you suppose it weighs on him any
less than on you? You’re wretched, he’s wretched, and what good can
come of it? while divorce would solve the difficulty completely.
I’m awfully sorry for you! And how happy I should be if I could
arrange things!
Don’t
speak, don’t say a word! God grant only that I may speak as I feel. I’m
going to him.
I’m not interrupting you?
No. Do you want anything?
Yes, I wished ... I wanted ... yes, I wanted to talk to you,
I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection
and respect for you,
I intended ... I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister
and your mutual position,
I think unceasingly of the same thing. And here is what I had begun
writing, thinking I could say it better by letter, and that my presence
irritates her,
I see that my presence is irksome to you. Painful as it is to me to
believe it, I see that it is so, and cannot be otherwise. I don’t blame
you, and God is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your
illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed
between us and to begin a new life. I do not regret, and shall never
regret, what I have done; but I have desired one thing—your good, the
good of your soul—and now I see I have not attained that. Tell me
yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul. I
put myself entirely in your hands, and trust to your feeling of what’s
right.
That’s what I wanted to say to her,
Yes, yes....
Yes, yes, I understand you,
I want to know what she would like,
I am afraid she does not understand her own position. She is not a
judge,
She is crushed,
simply crushed by your generosity. If she were to read this letter, she
would be incapable of saying anything, she would only hang her head
lower than ever.
Yes, but what’s to be done in that case? how explain, how find out her
wishes?
If you will allow me to give my opinion, I think that it lies with you
to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the
position.
So you consider it must be ended?
But how?
I see no possible way out of it.
There is some way of getting out of every position,
There was a time
when you thought of breaking off.... If you are convinced now that you
cannot make each other happy....
Happiness may be variously understood. But suppose that I agree to
everything, that I want nothing: what way is there of getting out of
our position?
If you care to know my opinion,
She will never speak out about it. But one thing is possible, one
thing she might desire,
that is the cessation of your
relations and all memories associated with them. To my thinking, in
your position what’s essential is the formation of a new attitude to
one another. And that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both
sides.
Divorce,
Yes, I imagine that divorce—yes, divorce,
That is from every point of view the most
rational course for married people who find themselves in the position
you are in. What can be done if married people find that life is
impossible for them together? That may always happen.
There’s only one point to be considered: is either of the parties
desirous of forming new ties? If not, it is very simple,
She will join him, and in a year or two he will
throw her over, or she will form a new tie,
And I, by agreeing to an unlawful divorce, shall be to
blame for her ruin.
The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce.
She does not want anything, does not dare ask you for anything, she
leaves it all to your generosity.
My God, my God! what for?
You are distressed, I understand that. But if you think it over....
Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also; and if any man take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also,
Yes, yes!
I will take the disgrace on
myself, I will give up even my son, but ... but wouldn’t it be better
to let it alone? Still you may do as you like....
Alexey Alexandrovitch, believe me, she appreciates your generosity,
But it seems it was the will of God,
This is an unhappy fatality, and one must accept it as such. I accept
the calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to help both
her and you,
But I’ll work it out better than that,
Varya,
I shot myself by accident.
And please never speak of it, and tell everyone so. Or else it’s too
ridiculous.
Thank God!
You’re not in pain?
A little here.
Then let me change your bandages.
I’m not delirious. Please manage that there may be no talk of my
having shot myself on purpose.
No one does say so. Only I hope you won’t shoot yourself by accident
any more,
Of course I won’t, but it would have been better....
To see her once and then to bury myself, to die,
So much the better,
It
was a weakness, which would have shattered what strength I have left.
Yes, you have conquered me, and I am yours,
So it had to be,
So long as we live, it must be so. I know
it now.
That’s true,
Still there is something terrible in it after all that has
happened.
It will all pass, it will all pass; we shall be so happy. Our love, if
it could be stronger, will be strengthened by there being something
terrible in it,
I don’t know you with this short hair. You’ve grown so pretty. A boy.
But how pale you are!
Yes, I’m very weak,
We’ll go to Italy; you will get strong,
Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your
family with you?
It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise.
Stiva says that _he_ has agreed to everything, but I can’t accept
_his_ generosity,
I
don’t want a divorce; it’s all the same to me now. Only I don’t know
what he will decide about Seryozha.
Don’t speak of that, don’t think of it,
Oh, why didn’t I die! it would have been better,
Do
what you choose, if it amuses you. I’m happy, and my happiness can be
no greater and no less for anything you do,
But I say,
have you a certificate of having been at
confession?
No. But what of it?
You can’t be married without it.
_Aïe, aïe, aïe!_
Why, I believe it’s nine years since
I’ve taken the sacrament! I never thought of it.
You’re a pretty fellow!
and you
call me a Nihilist! But this won’t do, you know. You must take the
sacrament.
When? There are four days left now.
Besides, what is it to you—two days? And he’s an awfully nice clever
old fellow. He’ll pull the tooth out for you so gently, you won’t
notice it.
Lord, have mercy on us!
It’s wonderful what
expression there is in her hand,
Have mercy on us again!
She took my hand then and
examined the lines. ‘You’ve got a splendid hand,’ she said.
Yes, now it
will soon be over,
No, it seems to be beginning again,
No, it’s just ending: there he
is bowing down to the ground. That’s always at the end.
It will come
right somehow,
Christ is present here unseen, receiving your confession,
Do you believe in all the doctrines of the
Holy Apostolic Church?
I have doubted, I doubt everything,
Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind, but we must pray that God
in His mercy will strengthen us. What are your special sins?
My chief sin is doubt. I have doubts of everything, and for the most
part I am in doubt.
Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind,
What do you doubt about principally?
I doubt of everything. I sometimes even have doubts of the existence
of God,
What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God?
What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation?
Who has decked the
heavenly firmament with its lights? Who has clothed the earth in its
beauty? How explain it without the Creator?
I don’t know,
You don’t know! Then how can you doubt that God created all?
I don’t understand it at all,
Pray to God and beseech Him. Even the holy fathers had doubts, and
prayed to God to strengthen their faith. The devil has great power, and
we must resist him. Pray to God, beseech Him. Pray to God,
You’re about, I hear, to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son
in the spirit, Prince Shtcherbatsky?
An
excellent young lady.
Yes,
What does he want to
ask me about this at confession for?
You are about to enter into holy matrimony, and God may bless you with
offspring. Well, what sort of bringing-up can you give your babes if
you do not overcome the temptation of the devil, enticing you to
infidelity?
If you love your
child as a good father, you will not desire only wealth, luxury, honor
for your infant; you will be anxious for his salvation, his spiritual
enlightenment with the light of truth. Eh? What answer will you make
him when the innocent babe asks you: ‘Papa! who made all that enchants
me in this world—the earth, the waters, the sun, the flowers, the
grass?’ Can you say to him: ‘I don’t know’? You cannot but know, since
the Lord God in His infinite mercy has revealed it to us. Or your child
will ask you: ‘What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb?’ What will
you say to him when you know nothing? How will you answer him? Will you
leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil? That’s not
right,
You are entering upon a time of life,
when you
must choose your path and keep to it. Pray to God that He may in His
mercy aid you and have mercy on you!
Our Lord and God,
Jesus Christ, in the abundance and riches of His loving-kindness,
forgives this child....
Of course, not now,
but some day later on.
See, now,
what a capable fellow was our friend Konstantin
Dmitrievitch. I’m not speaking of present company, for he’s absent. At
the time he left the university he was fond of science, took an
interest in humanity; now one-half of his abilities is devoted to
deceiving himself, and the other to justifying the deceit.
A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw,
Oh, no, I’m not an enemy of matrimony. I’m in favor of division of
labor. People who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the
rest work for their happiness and enlightenment. That’s how I look at
it. To muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur; I’m not one of
their number.
How happy I shall be when I hear that you’re in love!
Please invite me to the wedding.
I’m in love now.
Yes, with a cuttlefish! You know,
Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of
the....
Now, make a muddle of it! It doesn’t matter what about. And the fact
is, I certainly do love cuttlefish.
But that’s no hindrance to your loving your wife.
The cuttlefish is no hindrance. The wife is the hindrance.
Why so?
Oh, you’ll see! You care about farming, hunting,—well, you’d better
look out!
Arhip was here today; he said there were a lot of elks in Prudno, and
two bears,
Well, you must go and get them without me.
Ah, that’s the truth,
And you may say
good-bye to bear-hunting for the future—your wife won’t allow it!
Still, it’s a pity they should get those two bears without you. Do you
remember last time at Hapilovo? That was a delightful hunt!
There’s some sense in this custom of saying good-bye to bachelor
life,
However happy you may be, you must
regret your freedom.
And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the
window, like Gogol’s bridegroom?
Of course there is, but it isn’t confessed,
Oh, well, the window’s open. Let’s start off this instant to Tver!
There’s a big she-bear; one can go right up to the lair. Seriously,
let’s go by the five o’clock! And here let them do what they like,
Well, now, on my honor,
I can’t find in my
heart that feeling of regret for my freedom.
Yes, there’s such a chaos in your heart just now that you can’t find
anything there,
Wait a bit, when you set it to rights
a little, you’ll find it!
No; if so, I should have felt a little, apart from my feeling
and happiness, a certain regret at
losing my freedom.... On the contrary, I am glad at the very loss of my
freedom.
Awful! It’s a hopeless case!
Well, let’s drink to
his recovery, or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be
realized—and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on
earth!
Freedom!
What is freedom for? Happiness is only in loving and wishing her
wishes, thinking her thoughts, that is to say, not freedom at
all—that’s happiness!
But do I know her ideas, her wishes, her feelings?
What if she does not love me? What if she’s marrying me simply to be
married? What if she doesn’t see herself what she’s doing?
She may come to her senses, and only when she is being
married realize that she does not and cannot love me.
No, this can’t go on!
I’ll go to her; I’ll ask her; I’ll say for the last time: we
are free, and hadn’t we better stay so? Anything’s better than endless
misery, disgrace, unfaithfulness!
Ah!
Kostya!
Konstantin Dmitrievitch!
I didn’t expect you! I’m going through my
wardrobe to see what’s for whom....
Oh! that’s very nice!
You can go, Dunyasha, I’ll call you presently,
Kostya,
what’s the matter?
Kitty! I’m in torture. I can’t suffer alone,
I’ve come to say that there’s still time. This can all be
stopped and set right.
What? I don’t understand. What is the matter?
What I have said a thousand times over, and can’t help thinking ...
that I’m not worthy of you. You couldn’t consent to marry me. Think a
little. You’ve made a mistake. Think it over thoroughly. You can’t love
me.... If ... better say so,
I shall be
wretched. Let people say what they like; anything’s better than
misery.... Far better now while there’s still time....
I don’t understand,
you mean you want
to give it up ... don’t want it?
Yes, if you don’t love me.
You’re out of your mind!
What
are you thinking? tell me all.
I am thinking you can’t love me. What can you love me for?
My God! what can I do?...
Oh! what have I done?
How is it you don’t see? She’s a brunette, and it won’t suit her....
I’ve worked it all out.
As it is, she’s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks,
and then you must come and upset her with your nonsense,
Get along with you, my dear!
Come, I’ll tell you how we’ll manage: you drive in our carriage to
fetch him, and Sergey Ivanovitch, if he’ll be so good, will drive there
and then send his carriage.
Of course; I shall be delighted.
We’ll come on directly with him. Are your things sent off?
Yes,
It really is
strange, though!
Was ever a man in such a fearful fool’s position?
Yes, it is stupid,
But don’t worry, it’ll be brought directly.
No, what is to be done!
And these
fools of open waistcoats! Out of the question!
And what if the things have been taken on
to the railway station!
Then you must put on mine.
I ought to have done so long ago, if at all.
It’s not nice to look ridiculous.... Wait a bit! it will _come
round_.
But the shirt!
You’ve got a shirt on,
Only just in time. They were just lifting it into the van,
You won’t help matters like this,
It will come round,
it will come round ... I tell you.
They’ve come!
Here he is!
Which one?
Rather young, eh?
Why, my
dear soul, she looks more dead than alive!
I was beginning to think you meant to run away,
It’s so stupid, what happened to me, I’m ashamed to speak of it!
This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt!
Yes, yes!
Now, Kostya, you have to decide,
a weighty question. You are at this moment just in the
humor to appreciate all its gravity. They ask me, are they to light the
candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been
lighted? It’s a matter of ten roubles,
I have decided, but I was afraid you might not agree.
Well, how’s it to be then?—unlighted or lighted candles? that’s the
question.
Yes, yes, unlighted.
Oh, I’m very glad. The question’s decided!
How silly men are, though, in this position,
Kitty, mind you’re the first to step on the carpet,
You’re a nice person!
Aren’t you frightened, eh?
Are you cold? You’re pale. Stop a minute, stoop down,
Take the bride’s hand and lead her up,
Can it be true?
Blessed be the name of the Lord,
Blessed is the name of our God, from the beginning, is now, and ever
shall be,
Vouchsafe to them love made perfect, peace and help, O Lord, we
beseech Thee,
How did they guess that
it is help, just help that one wants?
What do I know? what can I do in this
fearful business,
without help? Yes, it is help I want
now.
Eternal God, that
joinest together in love them that were separate,
who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot
be set asunder, Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca and their
descendants, according to Thy Holy Covenant; bless Thy servants,
Konstantin and Ekaterina, leading them in the path of all good works.
For gracious and merciful art Thou, our Lord, and glory be to Thee, the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, now and ever shall be.
Amen!
‘Joinest together in love them that were separate.’ What deep meaning
in those words, and how they correspond with what one feels at this
moment,
Is she feeling the same as I?
The servant of God, Konstantin, plights his troth
to the servant of God, Ekaterina.
Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female,
from Thee woman was given to man to
be a helpmeet to him, and for the procreation of children. O Lord, our
God, who hast poured down the blessings of Thy Truth according to Thy
Holy Covenant upon Thy chosen servants, our fathers, from generation to
generation, bless Thy servants Konstantin and Ekaterina, and make their
troth fast in faith, and union of hearts, and truth, and love....
Why is it Marie’s in lilac, as bad as black, at a wedding?
With her complexion, it’s the one salvation,
I wonder why they had the wedding in the evening? It’s
like shop-people....
So much prettier. I was married in the evening too....
They say if anyone’s best man more than ten times, he’ll never be
married. I wanted to be for the tenth time, but the post was taken,
She ought not to have worn a chignon,
I
don’t like such grandeur.
Your brother may feel proud of himself. She’s a marvel of sweetness. I
believe you’re envious.
Oh, I’ve got over that, Darya Dmitrievna,
The wreath wants setting straight,
What a pity she’s lost her looks so,
Still he’s not worth her little finger, is he?
Oh, I like him so—not because he’s my future _beau-frère_,
And how well he’s behaving! It’s so difficult, too, to
look well in such a position, not to be ridiculous. And he’s not
ridiculous, and not affected; one can see he’s moved.
You expected it, I suppose?
Almost. She always cared for him.
Well, we shall see which of them will step on the rug first. I warned
Kitty.
It will make no difference,
we’re all obedient
wives; it’s in our family.
Oh, I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose. And you, Dolly?
It’s terribly
strange,
Why has she been crying? Is she being married against her will?
Against her will to a fine fellow like that? A prince, isn’t he?
Is that her sister in the white satin? Just listen how the deacon
booms out, ‘And fearing her husband.’
Are the choristers from Tchudovo?
No, from the Synod.
I asked the footman. He says he’s going to take her home to his
country place at once. Awfully rich, they say. That’s why she’s being
married to him.
No, they’re a well-matched pair.
I say, Marya Vassilievna, you were making out those fly-away
crinolines were not being worn. Just look at her in the puce dress—an
ambassador’s wife they say she is—how her skirt bounces out from side
to side!
What a pretty dear the bride is—like a lamb decked with flowers! Well,
say what you will, we women feel for our sister.
Endow them with continence and fruitfulness, and
vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and
daughters.
and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother, and cleave
unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh,
this is a
great mystery
That’s all splendid,
all that’s just as it should be,
Put it on quite,
Put it on!
Glory
to God.
Kiss your
wife, and you kiss your husband,
Ah! I’m glad to hear it,
Is madame at home or not?
Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now,
This gentleman is a Russian, and was inquiring after you,
Golenishtchev!
Vronsky!
You may like or
dislike my way of life, that’s a matter of the most perfect
indifference to me; you will have to treat me with respect if you want
to know me.
How glad I am to meet you!
I heard the name Vronsky, but I didn’t know which one. I’m very, very
glad!
Let’s go in. Come, tell me what you’re doing.
I’ve been living here for two years. I’m working.
Ah!
let’s go in.
Do you know Madame Karenina? We are traveling together. I am going to
see her now,
Ah! I did not know
Have you been here long?
Four days,
Yes, he’s a decent fellow, and will look at the thing properly,
I can introduce him to Anna, he looks
at it properly.
proper
properly
proper
It’s in the guide-book,
There’s a first-rate Tintoretto there. One of his
latest period.
I tell you what: it’s a lovely day, let’s go and have another look at
it,
I shall be very glad to; I’ll go and put on my hat. Would you say it’s
hot?
No, not very,
Well then,
so
you’re settled here? You’re still at the same work, then?
Yes, I’m writing the second part of the _Two Elements_,
that is, to be
exact, I am not writing it yet; I am preparing, collecting materials.
It will be of far wider scope, and will touch on almost all questions.
We in Russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of Byzantium,
I am very glad of one thing,
Alexey will have a capital _atelier_. You must
certainly take that room,
Do you paint?
Yes, I used to study long ago, and now I have begun to do a little,
He has great talent,
I’m no judge,
of course. But good judges have said the same.
I have inevitably made that
man wretched,
but I don’t want to profit by his misery.
I too am suffering, and shall suffer; I am losing what I prized above
everything—I am losing my good name and my son. I have done wrong, and
so I don’t want happiness, I don’t want a divorce, and shall suffer
from my shame and the separation from my child.
Here we live, and know nothing of what’s going on,
Have you seen
Mihailov’s picture?
I’ve seen it,
Of course, he’s not without
talent, but it’s all in a wrong direction. It’s all the
Ivanov-Strauss-Renan attitude to Christ and to religious painting.
What is the subject of the picture?
Christ before Pilate. Christ is represented as a Jew with all the
realism of the new school.
I can’t understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake. Christ
always has His definite embodiment in the art of the great masters. And
therefore, if they want to depict, not God, but a revolutionist or a
sage, let them take from history a Socrates, a Franklin, a Charlotte
Corday, but not Christ. They take the very figure which cannot be taken
for their art, and then....
And is it true that this Mihailov is in such poverty?
I should say not. He’s a remarkable portrait-painter. Have you ever
seen his portrait of Madame Vassiltchikova? But I believe he doesn’t
care about painting any more portraits, and so very likely he is in
want. I maintain that....
Couldn’t we ask him to paint a portrait of Anna Arkadyevna?
Why mine?
After yours I don’t want another portrait.
Better have one of Annie
Here she is,
Do you know this Mihailov?
I have met him. But he’s a queer fish, and quite without breeding. You
know, one of those uncouth new people one’s so often coming across
nowadays, one of those free-thinkers you know, who are reared
_d’emblée_ in theories of atheism, scepticism, and materialism. In
former days,
in former days
the free-thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of
religion, law, and morality, and only through conflict and struggle
came to free-thought; but now there has sprung up a new type of born
free-thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of
morality or of religion, of the existence of authorities, who grow up
directly in ideas of negation in everything, that is to say, savages.
Well, he’s of that class. He’s the son, it appears, of some Moscow
butler, and has never had any sort of bringing-up. When he got into the
academy and made his reputation he tried, as he’s no fool, to educate
himself. And he turned to what seemed to him the very source of
culture—the magazines. In old times, you see, a man who wanted to
educate himself—a Frenchman, for instance—would have set to work to
study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historians
and philosophers, and, you know, all the intellectual work that came in
his way. But in our day he goes straight for the literature of
negation, very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of
negation, and he’s ready. And that’s not all—twenty years ago he would
have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities, with
the creeds of the ages; he would have perceived from this conflict that
there was something else; but now he comes at once upon a literature in
which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion, but it
is stated baldly that there is nothing else—evolution, natural
selection, struggle for existence—and that’s all. In my article
I’ve....
I tell you what,
I tell you
what,
let’s go and see him!
I’ve said it to you twenty times, don’t enter into details. You’re
fool enough at all times, and when you start explaining things in
Italian you’re a fool three times as foolish,
Don’t let it run so long; it’s not my fault. If I had the money....
Leave me in peace, for God’s sake!
Idiotic woman!
Oh! damn
them all!
No, that one was better ... where is
it?
That’s it! that’s it!
Coming, coming!
Come, Sasha, don’t be cross!
You were to blame. I was to blame. I’ll make it
all right.
Please step in,
Most likely they’ve already looked at all the antiques,
and now they’re making the round of the studios of the new people, the
German humbug, and the cracked Pre-Raphaelite English fellow, and have
only come to me to make the point of view complete,
Here, if you please,
it’s the exhortation to Pilate. Matthew,
chapter xxvii,
I think I’ve had the pleasure of meeting you,
To be sure! We met at Rossi’s, do you remember, at that _soirée_ when
that Italian lady recited—the new Rachel?
Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time; and
what strikes me particularly now, as it did then, is the figure of
Pilate. One so knows the man: a good-natured, capital fellow, but an
official through and through, who does not know what it is he’s doing.
But I fancy....
How marvelous Christ’s expression is!
One can see that He is pitying Pilate.
Yes, and how that figure is done—what atmosphere! One can walk round
it,
Yes, there’s a wonderful mastery!
How those figures in
the background stand out! There you have technique,
Yes, yes, marvelous!
One thing might be said, if you will allow me to make the remark....
Oh, I shall be delighted, I beg you,
That is, that you make Him the man-god, and not the God-man. But I
know that was what you meant to do.
I cannot paint a Christ that is not in my heart,
Yes; but in that case, if you will allow me to say what I think....
Your picture is so fine that my observation cannot detract from it,
and, besides, it is only my personal opinion. With you it is different.
Your very motive is different. But let us take Ivanov. I imagine that
if Christ is brought down to the level of an historical character, it
would have been better for Ivanov to select some other historical
subject, fresh, untouched.
But if this is the greatest subject presented to art?
If one looked one would find others. But the point is that art cannot
suffer doubt and discussion. And before the picture of Ivanov the
question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike, ‘Is it God,
or is it not God?’ and the unity of the impression is destroyed.
Why so? I think that for educated people,
the
question cannot exist.
Oh, how exquisite! What a lovely thing! A gem! How exquisite!
What is it they’re so pleased with?
Oh, that’s only an old study,
How fine!
It is put up there to be sold,
What an
exquisite thing! How he has succeeded in it, and how simply! He doesn’t
even comprehend how good it is. Yes, I mustn’t let it slip; I must buy
it,
One needs to know and love her as I have loved
her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul,
I have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything,
and he just looked and painted it.
That’s where technique comes in.
That will come,
your excellency,
Not envious, let us say, since he has _talent_; but it annoys him that
a wealthy man of the highest society, and a count, too (you know they
all detest a title), can, without any particular trouble, do as well,
if not better, than he who has devoted all his life to it. And more
than all, it’s a question of culture, which he is without.
What is it?
You’ve been enjoying yourself,
He’s
jealous,
Goodness! how sweet and silly he is! He’s
jealous of me! If he knew that I think no more of them than of Piotr
the cook,
Though it’s a pity to take him from
his work (but he has plenty of time!), I must look at his face; will he
feel I’m looking at him? I wish he’d turn round ... I’ll _will_ him
to!
Yes, they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of
prosperity,
Well?
He looked round,
It’s nothing; I wanted you to look round,
How happy we are alone together!—I am, that is,
I’m just as happy. I’ll never go anywhere, especially not to Moscow.
And what were you thinking about?
I? I was thinking.... No, no, go along, go on writing; don’t break
off,
and I must cut out these little
holes now, do you see?
No; tell me, what was it?
Oh! what was I thinking about? I was thinking about Moscow, about the
back of your head.
Why should I, of all people, have such happiness! It’s unnatural, too
good,
I feel quite the opposite; the better things are, the more natural it
seems to me.
And you’ve got a little curl loose,
A little curl, oh yes. No, no, we are busy at our work!
Have they come from the town?
They’ve just come; they’re unpacking the things.
Come quickly,
or else
I shall read your letters without you.
It’s not right to go on like this,
It’ll soon be three months, and I’m doing next to nothing. Today,
almost for the first time, I set to work seriously, and what happened?
I did nothing but begin and throw it aside. Even my ordinary pursuits I
have almost given up. On the land I scarcely walk or drive about at all
to look after things. Either I am loath to leave her, or I see she’s
dull alone. And I used to think that, before marriage, life was nothing
much, somehow didn’t count, but that after marriage, life began in
earnest. And here almost three months have passed, and I have spent my
time so idly and unprofitably. No, this won’t do; I must begin. Of
course, it’s not her fault. She’s not to blame in any way. I ought
myself to be firmer, to maintain my masculine independence of action;
or else I shall get into such ways, and she’ll get used to them too....
Of course she’s not to blame,
That fool Tcharsky: she wanted, I know, to stop him, but didn’t know
how to.
Yes, apart from her interest in the house (that she has),
apart from dress and _broderie anglaise_, she has no serious interests.
No interest in her work, in the estate, in the peasants, nor in music,
though she’s rather good at it, nor in reading. She does nothing, and
is perfectly satisfied.
You see, your good lady’s settled me here, told me to sit a bit with
her,
Here, I opened your letter too,
It’s from that woman, I think, your brother’s....
I did not read it through. This is from my people and from Dolly.
Fancy! Dolly took Tanya and Grisha to a children’s ball at the
Sarmatskys’: Tanya was a French marquise.
It’s always of you he has talked, and,
besides, he has no more money left.
Read this; Dolly writes about you,
What is it? What’s the matter?
She writes to me that Nikolay, my brother, is at death’s door. I shall
go to him.
When are you going?
Tomorrow.
And I will go with you, can I?
Kitty! What are you thinking of?
How do you mean?
Why shouldn’t I go? I shan’t be in your
way. I....
I’m going because my brother is dying,
Why should
you....
Why? For the same reason as you.
And, at a moment of such gravity for me, she only thinks of her being
dull by herself,
It’s out of the question,
I tell you, that if you go, I shall come with you; I shall certainly
come,
Why out of the question? Why
do you say it’s out of the question?
Because it’ll be going God knows where, by all sorts of roads and to
all sorts of hotels. You would be a hindrance to me,
Not at all. I don’t want anything. Where you can go, I can....
Well, for one thing then, because this woman’s there whom you can’t
meet.
I don’t know and don’t care to know who’s there and what. I know that
my husband’s brother is dying and my husband is going to him, and I go
with my husband too....
Kitty! Don’t get angry. But just think a little: this is a matter of
such importance that I can’t bear to think that you should bring in a
feeling of weakness, of dislike to being left alone. Come, you’ll be
dull alone, so go and stay at Moscow a little.
There, you always ascribe base, vile motives to me,
I didn’t mean, it wasn’t weakness, it
wasn’t ... I feel that it’s my duty to be with my husband when he’s in
trouble, but you try on purpose to hurt me, you try on purpose not to
understand....
No; this is awful! To be such a slave!
Then why did you marry? You could have been free. Why did you, if you
regret it?
Kitty!
Go, do go!
Well, how is he? how is he?
Very bad. He can’t get up. He has kept expecting you. He.... Are you
... with your wife?
I’ll go away. I’ll go down to the kitchen,
Nikolay
Dmitrievitch will be delighted. He heard about it, and knows your lady,
and remembers her abroad.
Come along, come along to him!
Well! how is he?
But one can’t go on talking in the passage like this!
Well then, come in,
or go
on; go, and then come for me,
It cannot be that that fearful body was my brother Nikolay?
You did not expect to find me like this,
Yes ... no,
How was it you
didn’t let me know before, that is, at the time of my wedding? I made
inquiries in all directions.
Very well, and I’ll tell her to tidy up here. It’s dirty and stinking
here, I expect. Marya! clear up the room,
Oh, and when you’ve cleared up, go away yourself,
Why should she suffer as I
am suffering?
Well, how is he?
Oh, it’s awful, it’s awful! What did you come for?
Kostya! take me to him; it will be easier for us to bear it together.
You only take me, take me to him, please, and go away,
You
must understand that for me to see you, and not to see him, is far more
painful. There I might be a help to you and to him. Please, let me!
We have met, though we were not acquainted, at Soden,
You
never thought I was to be your sister?
You would not have recognized me?
Yes, I should. What a good thing you let us know! Not a day has passed
that Kostya has not mentioned you, and been anxious.
I am afraid you are not quite comfortable here,
We must ask
about another room,
so that we might be
nearer.
Make haste,
Oh, don’t you come,
I’ll do it my
myself....
What say?
I’m not looking, I’m not looking!
Marya Nikolaevna, you come this side, you do it,
Please go for me, there’s a little bottle in my small bag,
you know, in the side pocket; bring it,
please, and meanwhile they’ll finish clearing up here.
Your Katya.
I’m much better already,
Why, with you I should have got
well long ago. How nice it is!
Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed,
On the other side,
he always sleeps on that
side. Turn him over, it’s so disagreeable calling the servants. I’m not
strong enough. Can you?
I’m afraid not,
Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto babes.
wise and
prudent.
If I look at him he will think I am studying him, I am
afraid; if I don’t look at him, he’ll think I’m thinking of other
things. If I walk on tiptoe, he will be vexed; to tread firmly, I’m
ashamed.
Well, thank
God, he took the sacrament and received absolution; God grant each one
of us such a death.
I am very glad I persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow,
I
have never seen it, but I know, mamma has told me, there are prayers
said for recovery.
Do you suppose he can possibly recover?
I asked the doctor; he said he couldn’t live more than three days. But
can they be sure? I’m very glad, anyway, that I persuaded him,
Anything is
possible,
Yes, you see this woman, Marya Nikolaevna, did not know how to manage
all this,
And ... I must own I’m very, very glad you
came. You are such purity that....
It would have been miserable for you to be alone,
No,
she did not know how.... Luckily, I learned a lot at Soden.
Surely there are not people there so ill?
Worse.
What’s so awful to me is that I can’t see him as he was when he was
young. You would not believe how charming he was as a youth, but I did
not understand him then.
I can quite, quite believe it. How I feel that we might have been
friends!
Yes, _might have been_,
He’s just one of those
people of whom they say they’re not for this world.
But we have many days before us; we must go to bed,
If Thou dost exist, make this man to recover
and Thou
wilt save him and me.
Is he better?
Yes, much.
It’s wonderful.
There’s nothing wonderful in it.
Anyway, he’s better,
Is Katya not here?
No; so I can say it.... It was for her
sake I went through that farce. She’s so sweet; but you and I can’t
deceive ourselves. This is what I believe in,
He is dying!
I’m
afraid will die this minute.
How do you feel?
I feel I’m setting off,
Katya, go away!
I’m setting off,
Why do you think so?
Because I’m setting off,
It’s the end.
You had better lie down; you’d be easier,
I shall lie down soon enough,
when I’m dead,
Well, you can lay me down if you
like.
Yes, yes, so,
Wait a
little.
Right!
O Lord!
They’re getting cold,
Don’t go away,
Don’t go.
I’m
suffering horribly, intolerably!
What am I to write to him?
I hope you are not angry with
him?
No, not the least!
Tell him
to send me a doctor.
Oh, if it were only the end!
When
will it be over?
Turn me
over on the other side,
Give me some broth. Take away
the broth. Talk of something: why are you silent?
How do you feel?
Worse,
In pain!
In pain, where?
Everywhere.
It will be over today, you will see,
Why do you think so?
He has begun picking at himself,
How do you mean?
Like this,
He is gone,
Not quite ... soon.
Excuse me, your excellency, for venturing to trouble you. But if you
direct us to apply to her excellency, would you graciously oblige us
with her address?
You have heard of my trouble?
So you’ll get this ready for me?
_J’ai forcé la consigne_,
I have heard all!
Alexey Alexandrovitch! Dear friend!
Won’t you sit down, countess? I’m seeing no one because I’m unwell,
countess,
Dear friend!
Dear friend!
You ought
not to give way to grief. Your sorrow is a great one, but you ought to
find consolation.
I am crushed, I am annihilated, I am no longer a man!
My position is so awful because I can find nowhere, I cannot
find within me strength to support me.
You will find support; seek it—not in me, though I beseech you to
believe in my friendship,
Our support is love,
that love that He has vouchsafed us. His burden is light,
He will
be your support and your succor.
I am weak. I am crushed. I foresaw nothing, and now I understand
nothing.
Dear friend,
It’s not the loss of what I have not now, it’s not that!
I do not grieve for that. But I cannot help
feeling humiliated before other people for the position I am placed in.
It is wrong, but I can’t help it, I can’t help it.
Not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness, at which I was
moved to ecstasy, and everyone else too, but He, working within your
heart,
and so you cannot be ashamed of your act.
One must know all the facts,
A man’s
strength has its limits, countess, and I have reached my limits. The
whole day I have had to be making arrangements, arrangements about
household matters arising
from my
new, solitary position. The servants, the governess, the accounts....
These pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart, and I have not the
strength to bear it. At dinner ... yesterday, I was almost getting up
from the dinner-table. I could not bear the way my son looked at me. He
did not ask me the meaning of it all, but he wanted to ask, and I could
not bear the look in his eyes. He was afraid to look at me, but that is
not all....
I understand, dear friend,
I understand it all.
Succor and comfort you will find not in me, though I have come only to
aid you if I can. If I could take from off you all these petty,
humiliating cares ... I understand that a woman’s word, a woman’s
superintendence is needed. You will intrust it to me?
Together we will take care of Seryozha. Practical affairs are not my
strong point. But I will set to work. I will be your housekeeper. Don’t
thank me. I do it not from myself....
I cannot help thanking you.
But, dear friend, do not give way to the feeling of which you
spoke—being ashamed of what is the Christian’s highest glory: _he who
humbles himself shall be exalted_. And you cannot thank me. You must
thank Him, and pray to Him for succor. In Him alone we find peace,
consolation, salvation, and love,
I am very, very grateful to you, both for your deeds and for your
words,
Now I will enter upon my duties,
I am going to Seryozha. Only in
the last extremity shall I apply to you.
Who brought it?
A commissionaire from the hotel.
Madame la Comtesse,

“The Christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the, I
feel, unpardonable boldness to write to you. I am miserable at being
separated from my son. I entreat permission to see him once before my
departure. Forgive me for recalling myself to your memory. I apply to
you and not to Alexey Alexandrovitch, simply because I do not wish to
cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me. Knowing your
friendship for him, I know you will understand me. Could you send
Seryozha to me, or should I come to the house at some fixed hour, or
will you let me know when and where I could see him away from home? I
do not anticipate a refusal, knowing the magnanimity of him with whom
it rests. You cannot conceive the craving I have to see him, and so
cannot conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me.

“Anna.
Say that there is no answer,
I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject. There we will
arrange where to meet. Best of all at my house, where I will order tea
_as you like it_. Urgent. He lays the cross, but He gives the strength
to bear it,
If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and Princess
Vatkovskaya were Commander-in-Chief,
And me among the adjutants,
You have an appointment already. You’re over the ecclesiastical
department. And your assistant’s Karenin.
Good-day, prince!
What were you saying of Karenin?
He and Putyatov have received the Alexander Nevsky.
I thought he had it already.
No. Just look at him,
Pleased and happy as a
brass farthing,
No; he’s looking older,
From overwork. He’s always drawing up projects nowadays. He won’t let
a poor devil go nowadays till he’s explained it all to him under
heads.
Looking older, did you say? _Il fait des passions_. I believe Countess
Lidia Ivanovna’s jealous now of his wife.
Oh, come now, please don’t say any harm of Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
Why, is there any harm in her being in love with Karenin?
But is it true Madame Karenina’s here?
Well, not here in the palace, but in Petersburg. I met her yesterday
with Alexey Vronsky, _bras dessous, bras dessous_, in the Morsky.
_C’est un homme qui n’a pas_,...
He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord,
how he may please the Lord: but he that is married careth for the
things that are of the world, how he may please his wife,
And how strong they all are, how sound physically,
Truly is it said that all the world is evil,
Ah! Alexey Alexandrovitch!
I haven’t congratulated you
yet,
Thank you,
What an _exquisite_ day
today,
I congratulate you,
How is our angel?
I can’t say I was quite pleased with him,
And Sitnikov is not
satisfied with him.
As I have mentioned to you, there’s a
sort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which
ought to touch the heart of every man and every child....
Yes, but the heart. I see in him his father’s heart, and with such a
heart a child cannot go far wrong,
Yes, perhaps.... As for me, I do my duty. It’s all I can do.
You’re coming to me,
we
have to speak of a subject painful for you. I would give anything to
have spared you certain memories, but others are not of the same mind.
I have received a letter from _her_. _She_ is here in Petersburg.
I was expecting it,
Well now, we can sit quietly,
and
talk over our tea.
I don’t think I have the right to refuse her,
Dear friend, you never see evil in anyone!
On the contrary, I see that all is evil. But whether it is just....
No,
there are limits to
everything. I can understand immorality,
but I don’t understand cruelty: to whom? to you! How can
she stay in the town where you are? No, the longer one lives the more
one learns. And I’m learning to understand your loftiness and her
baseness.
Who is to throw a stone?
I have forgiven all, and so I
cannot deprive her of what is exacted by love in her—by her love for
her son....
But is that love, my friend? Is it sincere? Admitting that you have
forgiven—that you forgive—have we the right to work on the feelings of
that angel? He looks on her as dead. He prays for her, and beseeches
God to have mercy on her sins. And it is better so. But now what will
he think?
I had not thought of that,
If you ask my advice,
I do not advise you to do this. Do you suppose I
don’t see how you are suffering, how this has torn open your wounds?
But supposing that, as always, you don’t think of yourself, what can it
lead to?—to fresh suffering for you, to torture for the child. If there
were a trace of humanity left in her, she ought not to wish for it
herself. No, I have no hesitation in saying I advise not, and if you
will intrust it to me, I will write to her.
Dear Madame,

“To be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to
questions on his part which could not be answered without implanting in
the child’s soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him
sacred, and therefore I beg you to interpret your husband’s refusal in
the spirit of Christian love. I pray to Almighty God to have mercy on
you.

“Countess Lidia.
But how have I been to blame?
Well, Kapitonitch?
Well, has the bandaged clerk been here
today? Did papa see him?
He saw him. The minute the chief secretary came out, I announced him,
Here, I’ll take it
off.
Seryozha!
Take it off yourself.
Well, and did papa do what he wanted for him?
Well, was he very glad?
Glad? I should think so! Almost dancing as he walked away.
And has anything been left?
Come, sir,
Something from the countess.
What do you say? Where?
Korney took it to your papa. A fine plaything it must be too!
How big? Like this?
Rather small, but a fine thing.
A book.
No, a thing. Run along, run along, Vassily Lukitch is calling you,
Vassily Lukitch, in a tiny minute!
You know papa’s received the Alexander Nevsky today?
To be sure I do! People have been already to congratulate him.
And is he glad?
Glad at the Tsar’s gracious favor! I should think so! It’s a proof
he’s deserved it,
Well, and has your daughter been to see you lately?
When is she to come on week-days? They’ve their lessons to learn too.
And you’ve your lesson, sir; run along.
What do you think?
No, do just tell me, Vassily Lukitch,
what is greater
than the Alexander Nevsky? You know papa’s received the Alexander
Nevsky?
And higher still?
Well, highest of all is the Andrey Pervozvanny.
And higher than the Andrey?
I don’t know.
What, you don’t know?
suddenly
Mihail Ivanitch, when is your birthday?
You’d much better be thinking about your work. Birthdays are of no
importance to a rational being. It’s a day like any other on which one
has to do one’s work.
But why have they
all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and
most useless stuff? Why does he keep me off; why doesn’t he love me?
Here is your papa!
Did you have a nice walk?
Yes, it was very nice indeed, papa,
I saw Nadinka
She told me you’d been given a new star. Are you glad,
papa?
First of all, don’t rock your chair, please,
And secondly, it’s not the reward that’s precious, but
the work itself. And I could have wished you understood that. If you
now are going to work, to study in order to win a reward, then the work
will seem hard to you; but when you work
loving your work, you will find your reward in
it.
You understand that, I hope?
Yes, papa,
suddenly
And why
cannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven?
Well, what are the names of the patriarchs?
Enoch, Enos—
But you have said that already. This is bad, Seryozha, very bad. If
you don’t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a
Christian,
whatever can interest you? I
am displeased with you, and Piotr Ignatitch
is displeased with you.... I shall have to
punish you.
Vassily Lukitch, do you know what I prayed for tonight extra besides
the regular things?
That you might learn your lessons better?
No.
Toys?
No. You’ll never guess. A splendid thing; but it’s a secret! When it
comes to pass I’ll tell you. Can’t you guess!
No, I can’t guess. You tell me,
Come, lie down, I’m putting out the candle.
Without the candle I can see better what I see and what I prayed for.
There! I was almost telling the secret!
If the world disapproves, I don’t care,
but if my
relations want to be on terms of relationship with me, they will have
to be on the same terms with my wife.
Of course,
she would not be received at court, but intimate friends can
and must look at it in the proper light.
At last!
And Anna? How glad I am! Where
are you stopping? I can fancy after your delightful travels you must
find our poor Petersburg horrid. I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome.
How about the divorce? Is that all over?
People will throw stones at me, I know,
but I shall come
and see Anna; yes, I shall certainly come. You won’t be here long, I
suppose?
You’ve never told me when the divorce is to be? Supposing I’m ready to
fling my cap over the mill, other starchy people will give you the cold
shoulder until you’re married. And that’s so simple nowadays. _Ça se
fait_. So you’re going on Friday? Sorry we shan’t see each other
again.
You know, Alexey,
how fond I am of you,
and how ready I am to do anything for you; but I have not spoken,
because I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna,
Anna Arkadyevna
Don’t suppose, please, that I judge her. Never; perhaps in her place I
should have done the same. I don’t and can’t enter into that,
But one must call things by
their names. You want me to go and see her, to ask her here, and to
rehabilitate her in society; but do understand that _I cannot_ do so. I
have daughters growing up, and I must live in the world for my
husband’s sake. Well, I’m ready to come and see Anna Arkadyevna: she
will understand that I can’t ask her here, or I should have to do so in
such a way that she would not meet people who look at things
differently; that would offend her. I can’t raise her....
Oh, I don’t regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do
receive!
Alexey! don’t be angry with me. Please understand that I’m not to
blame,
I’m not angry with you,
but I’m sorry in
two ways. I’m sorry, too, that this means breaking up our friendship—if
not breaking up, at least weakening it. You will understand that for
me, too, it cannot be otherwise.
This coldness—this pretense of feeling!
They
must needs insult me and torture the child, and I am to submit to it!
Not on any consideration! She is worse than I am. I don’t lie, anyway.
Run and see what’s wanted. Some lady,
Seryozha—Sergey Alexeitch,
Whom do you want?
From Prince Skorodumov for Sergey Alexeitch,
His honor’s not up yet,
Would you kindly wait?
Please walk in, your excellency,
The tutor’s there; maybe he’s not dressed. I’ll let him know.
This way, to the left, if you please. Excuse its not being tidy. His
honor’s in the old parlor now,
Excuse
me, wait a little, your excellency; I’ll just see,
He’s only just awake,
Let me in; go away!
Seryozha!
Seryozha!
Seryozha! my darling boy!
Mother!
I know,
it’s my birthday today. I knew
you’d come. I’ll get up directly.
What are you crying for, mother?
Mother, what are you crying for?
I won’t cry ... I’m crying for joy. It’s so long since I’ve seen you.
I won’t, I won’t,
Come, it’s time for you to dress now,
How do you dress without me? How....
I don’t have a cold bath, papa didn’t order it. And you’ve not seen
Vassily Lukitch? He’ll come in soon. Why, you’re sitting on my
clothes!
Mother, darling, sweet one!
I don’t want that on,
But what did you think about me? You didn’t think I was dead?
I never believed it.
You didn’t believe it, my sweet?
I knew, I knew!
I’ll wait
another ten minutes,
Oh yes, to be sure you’d not have let her in! After ten years’
service, and never a word but of kindness, and there you’d up and say,
‘Be off, go along, get away with you!’ Oh yes, you’re a shrewd one at
politics, I dare say! You don’t need to be taught how to swindle the
master, and to filch fur coats!
Soldier!
Here, what do you think, Marya Efimovna: he let her in
without a word to anyone,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch will be down immediately—and go into the nursery!
A pretty business, a pretty business!
You, Korney
Vassilievitch, you’d best keep him some way or other, the master, while
I’ll run and get her away somehow. A pretty business!
Mistress, darling!
God has brought joy indeed to our boy on his
birthday. You aren’t changed one bit.
Oh, nurse dear, I didn’t know you were in the house,
I’m not living here, I’m living with my daughter. I came for the
birthday, Anna Arkadyevna, darling!
Mother! She often comes to see me, and when she comes....
My sweet!
Darling, darling Kootik!
you won’t forget me?
You....
always at nine o’clock,
Don’t go yet. He won’t come just
yet.
Seryozha, my darling,
love him; he’s better and kinder
than I am, and I have done him wrong. When you grow up you will judge.
There’s no one better than you!...
My sweet, my little one!
He’s coming,
Yes, it’s all over, and I am again
alone,
Presently.
Later on,
Oh,
here is he!
But where is he? How is it he leaves me alone in my misery?
He’s not coming alone, and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me,
he’s not coming so that I could tell him everything, but
coming with Yashvin.
But he ought to tell me so. I must know that it is so. If I knew it,
then I know what I should do,
We have met already,
We met last year at the races. Give
them to me,
Were the races good this year? Instead of them I saw the races
in the Corso in Rome. But you don’t care for life abroad,
I know you and all your tastes, though I have
seen so little of you.
I’m awfully sorry for that, for my tastes are mostly bad,
Not long, I think,
So then we shan’t meet again?
Come and dine with me,
The dinner here is not
good, but at least you will see him. There is no one of his old friends
in the regiment Alexey cares for as he does for you.
Delighted,
Are you going too?
I’m late already,
Run along! I’ll catch you up in a
moment,
Wait a minute, there’s something I want to say to you,
Oh, was it right my asking him
to dinner?
You did quite right,
Alexey, you have not changed to me?
Alexey, I am miserable here. When are we going away?
Soon, soon. You wouldn’t believe how disagreeable our way of living
here is to me too,
Well, go, go!
Very sorry that I can’t come just between half-past six and nine,
The princess will be very sorry.
And so am I.
You’re going, no doubt, to hear Patti?
Patti? You suggest the idea to me. I would go if it were possible to
get a box.
I can get one,
I should be very, very grateful to you,
But won’t you
dine with us?
Are you really going to the theater?
Why do you ask with such alarm?
Why shouldn’t I go?
Oh, of course, there’s no reason whatever,
That’s just what I say,
Anna, for God’s sake! what is the matter with you?
I don’t understand what you are asking.
You know that it’s out of the question to go.
Why so? I’m not going alone. Princess Varvara has gone to dress, she
is going with me.
But do you mean to say you don’t know?...
But I don’t care to know!
I don’t care to. Do I
regret what I have done? No, no, no! If it were all to do again from
the beginning, it would be the same. For us, for you and for me, there
is only one thing that matters, whether we love each other. Other
people we need not consider. Why are we living here apart and not
seeing each other? Why can’t I go? I love you, and I don’t care for
anything,
If you have not changed to
me, why don’t you look at me?
My feeling cannot change, you know, but I beg you, I entreat you,
And I beg you to explain why I should not go.
Because it might cause you....
I don’t understand. Yashvin _n’est pas compromettant_, and Princess
Varvara is no worse than others. Oh, here she is!
In that dress, with a princess only too well known to everyone, to
show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging
your position as a fallen woman, but is flinging down a challenge to
society, that is to say, cutting yourself off from it forever.
But how can she fail to see it, and what
is going on in her?
You were talking of Lankovsky’s Powerful. That’s a fine horse, and I
would advise you to buy him,
His hind-quarters aren’t quite first-rate, but the legs
and head—one couldn’t wish for anything better.
I think I will take him,
Anna Arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the
theater.
Well, let’s go,
I’m not going,
Well, I must, I promised to. Good-bye, then. If you do, come to the
stalls; you can take Kruzin’s stall,
No, I’m busy.
A wife is a care, but it’s worse when she’s not a wife,
And what’s today? The fourth night.... Yegor and his wife are there,
and my mother, most likely. Of course all Petersburg’s there. Now she’s
gone in, taken off her cloak and come into the light. Tushkevitch,
Yashvin, Princess Varvara,
What about
me? Either that I’m frightened or have given up to Tushkevitch the
right to protect her? From every point of view—stupid, stupid!... And
why is she putting me in such a position?
If you care to be in my service,
you had better remember your duties. This shouldn’t be here. You ought
to have cleared away.
That’s not your duty; send the waiter to clear away, and get my dress
coat out.
Your Excellency,
How little of the military man there is left in you!
A diplomat, an artist, something of that sort, one
would say.
Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a black coat,
Well, I’ll own I envy you there. When I come back from abroad and put
on this,
I regret my freedom.
What a pity you were not in time for the first act!
Ah, Vronsky! When are you coming to the regiment? We can’t let you off
without a supper. You’re one of the old set,
I can’t stop, awfully sorry, another time,
I think it’s mean and hateful, and Madame Kartasova had no right to do
it. Madame Karenina....
But what is it? I don’t know.
What? you’ve not heard?
You know I should be the last person to hear of it.
There isn’t a more spiteful creature than that Madame Kartasova!
But what did she do?
My husband told me.... She has insulted Madame Karenina. Her husband
began talking to her across the box, and Madame Kartasova made a scene.
She said something aloud, he says, something insulting, and went away.
Count, your maman is asking for you,
I’ve been expecting you all the while,
You were nowhere to be seen.
Good evening, maman. I have come to you,
Why aren’t you going to _faire la cour à Madame Karenina?_
_Elle fait sensation. On
oublie la Patti pour elle_.
Maman, I have asked you not to say anything to me of that,
I’m only saying what everyone’s saying.
Ah, Alexey!
How disgusting! Idiot of a woman,
nothing else.... I wanted to go straight to her. Let’s go together.
There are no more tenors. _Le moule en est brisé!_
You came in late, I think, and have missed the best song,
I am a poor judge of music,
Like Prince Yashvin,
who considers that Patti
sings too loud.
Thank you,
hushes
Anna,
You, you are to blame for everything!
I begged, I implored you not to go, I knew it would be unpleasant....
Unpleasant!
hideous! As long as I live I shall never
forget it. She said it was a disgrace to sit beside me.
A silly woman’s chatter,
but why risk it, why provoke?...
I hate your calm. You ought not to have brought me to this. If you had
loved me....
Anna! How does the question of my love come in?
Oh, if you loved me, as I love, if you were tortured as I am!...
Shtcherbatsky element,
Take me with you. I am very fond of picking mushrooms,
I think it’s a very nice occupation.
Oh, we shall be delighted,
You have changed in many respects since your marriage, and for the
better,
but you have remained true to your
passion for defending the most paradoxical theories.
Katya, it’s not good for you to stand,
Oh, and there’s no time either,
Varenka’s waiting,
I’m coming, I’m coming, Varvara Andreevna,
And how sweet my Varenka is! eh?
And how
good-looking she is—such a refined beauty! Varenka!
Shall you be in the mill copse? We’ll come out to you.
You certainly forget your condition, Kitty,
You mustn’t shout like that.
Varenka, I should be very happy if a certain something were to
happen,
And are you coming with us?
I am coming, but only as far as the threshing-floor, and there I shall
stop.
Why, what do you want there?
I must go to have a look at the new wagons, and to check the invoice,
and where will you be?
On the terrace.
I always buy my maids’ dresses myself, of some cheap material,
Isn’t it time to
skim it, my dear?
There’s not
the slightest need for you to do it, and it’s hot for you,
I’ll do it,
How they’ll enjoy this
at tea-time!
Stiva says it’s much better to give money.
But....
Money’s out of the question!
They appreciate a present....
Well, last year, for instance, I bought our Matrona Semyenovna, not a
poplin, but something of that sort,
I remember she was wearing it on your nameday.
A charming pattern—so simple and refined,—I should have liked it
myself, if she hadn’t had it. Something like Varenka’s. So pretty and
inexpensive.
Well, now I think it’s done,
When it sets as it drops, it’s ready. Cook it a little longer, Agafea
Mihalovna.
The flies!
It’ll be just the same,
Ah! how sweet it is! don’t frighten it!
Yes, but you keep a little further from the stove,
_À propos de Varenka_,
you know, mamma, I somehow expect things to be
settled today. You know what I mean. How splendid it would be!
But what a famous matchmaker she is!
How carefully and
cleverly she throws them together!...
No; tell me, mamma, what do you think?
Why, what is one to think? He
might
at any time have been a match for anyone in Russia; now, of course,
he’s not quite a young man, still I know ever so many girls would be
glad to marry him even now.... She’s a very nice girl, but he
might....
Oh, no, mamma, do understand why, for him and for her too, nothing
better could be imagined. In the first place, she’s charming!
He thinks her very attractive, that’s certain,
Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to
look for either fortune or position in his wife. All he needs is a
good, sweet wife—a restful one.
Well, with her he would certainly be restful,
Thirdly, that she should love him. And so it is ... that is, it would
be so splendid!... I look forward to seeing them coming out of the
forest—and everything settled. I shall see at once by their eyes. I
should be so delighted! What do you think, Dolly?
But don’t excite yourself. It’s not at all the thing for you to be
excited,
Oh, I’m not excited, mamma. I fancy he will make her an offer today.
Ah, that’s so strange, how and when a man makes an offer!... There is
a sort of barrier, and all at once it’s broken down,
Mamma, how did papa make you an offer?
There was nothing out of the way, it was very simple,
Oh, but how was it? You loved him, anyway, before you were allowed to
speak?
Of course I did; he had come to stay with us in the country.
But how was it settled between you, mamma?
You imagine, I dare say, that you invented something quite new? It’s
always just the same: it was settled by the eyes, by smiles....
How nicely you said that, mamma! It’s just by the eyes, by smiles that
it’s done,
But what words did he say?
What did Kostya say to you?
He wrote it in chalk. It was wonderful.... How long ago it seems!
There’s one thing ... that old love affair of Varenka’s,
I should have liked
to say something to Sergey Ivanovitch, to prepare him. They’re all—all
men, I mean,
awfully jealous over our past.
Not all,
You judge by your own husband. It makes him
miserable even now to remember Vronsky. Eh? that’s true, isn’t it?
Yes,
But I really don’t know,
what there was in your past that could worry
him? That Vronsky paid you attentions—that happens to every girl.
Oh, yes, but we didn’t mean that,
No, let me speak,
why, you yourself would not
let me have a talk to Vronsky. Don’t you remember?
Oh, mamma!
There’s no keeping you young people in check nowadays.... Your
friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable. I should
myself have called upon him to explain himself. But, my darling, it’s
not right for you to be agitated. Please remember that, and calm
yourself.
I’m perfectly calm, maman.
How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then,
and how
unhappy for her. It turned out quite the opposite,
Then Anna was so happy, and Kitty thought herself
unhappy. Now it is just the opposite. I often think of her.
A nice person to think about! Horrid, repulsive woman—no heart,
What do you want to talk of it for?
I
never think about it, and I don’t want to think of it.... And I don’t
want to think of it,
What’s that you don’t want to think about?
I’m sorry I’ve broken in on your feminine parliament,
Well, how are you?
Oh, very well,
and how have things gone with
you?
The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did. Well, are we
going for the children? I’ve ordered the horses to be put in.
What! you want to take Kitty in the wagonette?
Yes, at a walking pace, princess.
maman
Come with us, maman,
I don’t like to see such imprudence.
Well, I’ll walk then, I’m so well.
You may be well, but everything in moderation,
Well, Agafea Mihalovna, is the jam done?
Is it all right in the
new way?
I suppose it’s all right. For our notions it’s boiled too long.
It’ll be all the better, Agafea Mihalovna, it won’t mildew, even
though our ice has begun to thaw already, so that we’ve no cool cellar
to store it,
but your
pickle’s so good, that mamma says she never tasted any like it,
You needn’t try to console me, mistress. I need only to look at you
with him, and I feel happy,
Come along with us to look for mushrooms, you will show us the best
places.
I should like to be angry with you too, but I can’t.
Do it, please, by my receipt,
put some paper over
the jam, and moisten it with a little rum, and without even ice, it
will never go mildewy.
So you’re not tired? Lean more on me,
No, I’m so glad of a chance of being alone with you, and I must own,
though I’m happy with them, I do regret our winter evenings alone.
That was good, but this is even better. Both are better,
Do you know what we were talking about when you came in?
About jam?
Oh, yes, about jam too; but afterwards, about how men make offers.
Ah!
And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka. You’ve noticed?... I’m very
anxious for it,
What do you think about it?
I don’t know what to think,
Sergey seems
very strange to me in that way. I told you, you know....
Yes, that he was in love with that girl who died....
That was when I was a child; I know about it from hearsay and
tradition. I remember him then. He was wonderfully sweet. But I’ve
watched him since with women; he is friendly, some of them he likes,
but one feels that to him they’re simply people, not women.
Yes, but now with Varenka ... I fancy there’s something....
Perhaps there is.... But one has to know him.... He’s a peculiar,
wonderful person. He lives a spiritual life only. He’s too pure, too
exalted a nature.
Why? Would this lower him, then?
No, but he’s so used to a spiritual life that he can’t reconcile
himself with actual fact, and Varenka is after all fact.
Yes, but there’s not so much of that actual fact about her as about
me. I can see that he would never have cared for me. She is altogether
spiritual.
Oh, no, he is so fond of you, and I am always so glad when my people
like you....
Yes, he’s very nice to me; but....
It’s not as it was with poor Nikolay ... you really cared for each
other,
Why not speak of him?
I sometimes
blame myself for not; it ends in one’s forgetting. Ah, how terrible and
dear he was!... Yes, what were we talking about?
You think he can’t fall in love,
It’s not so much that he can’t fall in love,
but he has not the weakness necessary.... I’ve always envied him, and
even now, when I’m so happy, I still envy him.
You envy him for not being able to fall in love?
I envy him for being better than I,
He does not live for
himself. His whole life is subordinated to his duty. And that’s why he
can be calm and contented.
And you?
And you? What are you dissatisfied with?
I am happy, but dissatisfied with myself....
Why, how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy?
Well, how shall I say?... In my heart I really care for nothing
whatever but that you should not stumble—see? Oh, but really you
mustn’t skip about like that!
But when I think about myself, and compare myself with others,
especially with my brother, I feel I’m a poor creature.
But in what way?
Don’t you too
work for others? What about your co-operative settlement, and your work
on the estate, and your book?...
Oh, but I feel, and particularly just now—it’s your fault,
that all that doesn’t count. I do it in a way
halfheartedly. If I could care for all that as I care for you!...
Instead of that, I do it in these days like a task that is set me.
Well, what would you say about papa?
Is he a poor
creature then, as he does nothing for the public good?
He?—no! But then one must have the simplicity, the
straightforwardness, the goodness of your father: and I haven’t got
that. I do nothing, and I fret about it. It’s all your doing. Before
there was you—and _this_ too,
I put all my energies into work; now I can’t, and
I’m ashamed; I do it just as though it were a task set me, I’m
pretending....
Well, but would you like to change this minute with Sergey
Ivanovitch?
Would you like to do this work for the
general good, and to love the task set you, as he does, and nothing
else?
Of course not,
But I’m so happy that I don’t understand
anything. So you think he’ll make her an offer today?
I think so, and I don’t think so. Only, I’m awfully anxious for it.
Here, wait a minute.
Come, count: he does propose, he doesn’t,
He does, he doesn’t,
No, no!
You picked off two.
Oh, but see, this little one shan’t count to make up,
Here’s the wagonette overtaking
us.
Aren’t you tired, Kitty?
Not in the least.
If you are you can get in, as the horses are quiet and walking.
If so,
I ought to think it over and make up my
mind, and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment.
I’m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my
efforts will make no show,
Why not?
If it were only a passing fancy or a passion,
if it were only this attraction—this mutual attraction (I can call it a
_mutual_ attraction), but if I felt that it was in contradiction with
the whole bent of my life—if I felt that in giving way to this
attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty ... but it’s
not so. The only thing I can say against it is that, when I lost Marie,
I said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory. That’s the
only thing I can say against my feeling.... That’s a great thing,
But apart from that, however much I searched, I should never
find anything to say against my feeling. If I were choosing by
considerations of suitability alone, I could not have found anything
better.
Varvara Andreevna, when I was very young, I set before myself the
ideal of the woman I loved and should be happy to call my wife. I have
lived through a long life, and now for the first time I have met what I
sought—in you. I love you, and offer you my hand.
Come here, little ones! There are so many!
Well, did you find some?
Not one,
Did you?
That one too, near the twig,
This brings back my childhood,
So you found nothing? In the middle of the wood there are always
fewer, though.
I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at
the edge of the wood, though I can’t tell them apart.
What is the difference between the ‘birch’ mushroom and the ‘white’
mushroom?
In the top part there is scarcely any difference, it’s in the stalk.
The birch mushroom’s stalk suggests a dark man’s chin after two days
without shaving,
Yes, that’s true,
Gently, children, gently!
Well?
It doesn’t bite,
How doesn’t bite?
I’ll show you,
Like a kiss on a
priest’s hand.
Which didn’t it bite with?
Both. But it should have been like this....
There are some peasants coming....
Oh, they didn’t see.
Mark my words, Alexander will not come,
And I know why,
he says that young people
ought to be left alone for a while at first.
But papa has left us alone. We’ve never seen him,
Besides, we’re not young people!—we’re old, married people by now.
Only if he doesn’t come, I shall say good-bye to you children,
What nonsense, mamma!
How do you suppose he is feeling? Why, now....
Maman always
finds something to be miserable about,
What is it, Agafea Mihalovna?
About supper.
Well, that’s right,
you go and arrange about it, and
I’ll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson, or else he will have nothing
done all day.
That’s my lesson! No, Dolly, I’m going,
No, I’m going, Dolly, you sit still,
We’ll do it all
properly, like the book. Only when Stiva comes, and we go out shooting,
then we shall have to miss it.
I’ll see to the supper, you sit still,
Yes, yes, most likely they’ve not been able to get chickens. If so,
ours....
Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it,
What a nice girl!
Not nice, maman; she’s an exquisite girl; there’s no one else like
her.
So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today?
It would be difficult to find two sons-in-law more unlike
than yours,
One all movement, only
living in society, like a fish in water; the other our Kostya, lively,
alert, quick in everything, but as soon as he is in society, he either
sinks into apathy, or struggles helplessly like a fish on land.
Yes, he’s very heedless,
I’ve been meaning, indeed, to ask you to tell him that
it’s out of the question for her
to stay here;
that she positively must come to Moscow. He talks of getting a doctor
down....
Maman, he’ll do everything; he has agreed to everything,
It’s Stiva!
We’ve finished,
Dolly, don’t be afraid!
_Is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_
And someone else too! Papa, of course!
Kitty, don’t come down the steep staircase, go
round.
A capital fellow, and a
keen sportsman,
Your wife and I are cousins and very old friends,
Well, are there plenty of birds?
We’ve come
with the most savage intentions. Why, maman, they’ve not been in Moscow
since! Look, Tanya, here’s something for you! Get it, please, it’s in
the carriage, behind!
How pretty you’ve
grown, Dolly,
Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips?
She doesn’t believe in his love. So what is she so pleased about?
Revolting!
It’s all holiday for them,
but these are no holiday
matters, they won’t wait, and there’s no living without them.
But why are you making all this fuss? Have what we usually do.
No, Stiva doesn’t drink ... Kostya, stop, what’s the matter?
Well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?
Please, do let’s go,
I shall be delighted, we will go. And have you had any shooting yet
this year?
I can’t answer for our
finding grouse, but there are plenty of snipe. Only we ought to start
early. You’re not tired? Aren’t you tired, Stiva?
Me tired? I’ve never been tired yet. Suppose we stay up all night.
Let’s go for a walk!
Yes, really, let’s not go to bed at all! Capital!
Oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people up
too,
But to my
thinking, it’s time for bed now.... I’m going, I don’t want supper.
No, do stay a little, Dolly,
I’ve so much
still to tell you.
Nothing really, I suppose.
Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna’s, and he’s going to them
again? You know they’re hardly fifty miles from you, and I too must
certainly go over there. Veslovsky, come here!
Ah, do tell me, please; you have stayed with her? How was she?
It’s exceedingly nice at their place,
I can’t, of course, take it upon myself to
judge, but in their house you feel the real feeling of home.
What do they intend doing?
I believe they think of going to Moscow.
How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together! When are
you going there?
I’m spending July there.
Will you go?
I’ve been wanting to a long while; I shall certainly go,
I am sorry for her, and I know her. She’s a splendid woman. I will go
alone, when you go back, and then I shall be in no one’s way. And it
will be better indeed without you.
To be sure,
And you, Kitty?
I? Why should I go?
Do you know Anna Arkadyevna, then?
She’s a very
fascinating woman.
Yes,
Are you going shooting, then, tomorrow?
Yes, I’m going,
No, better spend the day here tomorrow, or Dolly won’t see anything of
her husband, and set off the day after,
Don’t
separate me from _him_. I don’t care about _your_ going, but do let me
enjoy the society of this delightful young man.
Oh, if you wish, we’ll stay here tomorrow,
How dare he look at my wife like that!
Tomorrow, then? Do, please, let us go,
We don’t like that fashion.
Why, how can one want to go to bed!
Look, Kitty,
how exquisite!
Veslovsky, this is the time for a serenade. You know, he has a splendid
voice; we practiced songs together along the road. He has brought some
lovely songs with him, two new ones. Varvara Andreevna and he must sing
some duets.
Was there perhaps something you disliked about
Veslovsky?
You must understand that I’m not jealous, that’s a nasty word. I can’t
be jealous, and believe that.... I can’t say what I feel, but this is
awful.... I’m not jealous, but I’m wounded, humiliated that anybody
dare think, that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that.
Eyes like what?
And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now?...
Ah!
you shouldn’t say that!... If
you had been attractive then....
Oh, no, Kostya, oh, wait a minute, oh, do listen!
Why, what can you
be thinking about! When for me there’s no one in the world, no one, no
one!... Would you like me never to see anyone?
You must understand the horror and comedy of my position,
that he’s in my house, that he’s done nothing
improper positively except his free and easy airs and the way he sits
on his legs. He thinks it’s the best possible form, and so I’m obliged
to be civil to him.
But, Kostya, you’re exaggerating,
The most awful part of it all is that you’re just as you always are,
and especially now when to me you’re something sacred, and we’re so
happy, so particularly happy—and all of a sudden a little wretch....
He’s not a little wretch; why should I abuse him? I have nothing to do
with him. But why should my, and your, happiness....
Do you know, I understand now what it’s all come from,
Well, what? what?
I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper.
Well, well!
Katya, I’ve been worrying you! Darling, forgive me! It’s madness!
Katya, I’m a criminal. And how could you be so distressed at such
idiocy?
Oh, I was sorry for you.
For me? for me? How mad I am!... But why make you miserable? It’s
awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness.
It’s humiliating too, of course.
Oh, then I’ll keep him here all the summer, and will overwhelm him
with civility,
You shall see.
Tomorrow.... Oh, yes, we are going tomorrow.
Good dog, good dog, Krak!
Well, and what about our host?
A young wife,
Yes, and such a charming one!
He came down dressed. No doubt he’s run up to her again.
Pardon, gentlemen!
Have you put
the lunch in? Why is the chestnut on the right? Well, it doesn’t
matter. Laska, down; go and lie down!
Put it with the herd of oxen,
Excuse me, here comes
another villain.
You didn’t come to the counting house yesterday, and now you’re
detaining me. Well, what is it?
Would your honor let me make another turning? It’s only three steps to
add. And we make it just fit at the same time. It will be much more
convenient.
You should have listened to me,
I
said: Put the lines and then fit in the steps. Now there’s no setting
it right. Do as I told you, and make a new staircase.
It will be much better.
But where’s your staircase coming out with its three steps?
Why, upon my word, sir,
It comes out right at the very spot. It starts, so to speak,
it comes down, and comes down, and comes
out.
But three steps will add to the length too ... where is it to come
out?
Why, to be sure, it’ll start from the bottom and go up and go up, and
come out so,
It’ll reach the ceiling and the wall.
Upon my word! Why, it’ll go up, and up, and come out like this.
There, do you see?
As your honor likes,
It seems it’ll be
best to make a new one.
Well, then, do it as you’re told,
Down! Hold the dogs, Philip!
How fine it must
be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse! Eh? isn’t it?
Do you know what, Levin, I’ll gallop home on that left trace-horse.
That will be splendid. Eh?
No, why should you?
I’ll send the coachman.
Well, now what’s our plan of campaign? Tell us all about it,
Our plan is this. Now we’re driving to Gvozdyov. In Gvozdyov there’s a
grouse marsh on this side, and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnificent
snipe marshes where there are grouse too. It’s hot now, and we’ll get
there—it’s fifteen miles or so—towards evening and have some evening
shooting; we’ll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger
moors.
And is there nothing on the way?
Yes; but we’ll reserve ourselves; besides it’s hot. There are two nice
little places, but I doubt there being anything to shoot.
Shan’t we try that?
Levin, do, please! how delightful!
Krak! Laska!...
There won’t be room for three. I’ll stay here,
No! Come along, Levin, let’s go together!
Really, there’s not room. Laska, back, Laska! You won’t want another
dog, will you?
Come, you see now that it was not that I grudged the marsh,
only it’s wasting time.
Oh, no, it was jolly all the same. Did you see us?
How splendidly I shot this bird! Didn’t I? Well,
shall we soon be getting to the real place?
Now you go and I’ll stay with the horses,
Why don’t you stop her?
She won’t scare them,
Come, come, Stiva!
Fetch it!
Damn the fellow!
What did you drive in for?
_Bon appétit—bonne conscience! Ce poulet va tomber jusqu’au fond de
mes bottes_,
Well, now our
troubles are over, now everything’s going to go well. Only, to atone
for my sins, I’m bound to sit on the box. That’s so? eh? No, no! I’ll
be your Automedon. You shall see how I’ll get you along,
No, I must atone for my sins, and I’m very comfortable on the
box.
How shall we go? It’s a splendid marsh, I see, and there are hawks,
Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.
Now, gentlemen,
do you see those
reeds?
The marsh
begins here, straight in front of us, do you see—where it is greener?
From here it runs to the right where the horses are; there are breeding
places there, and grouse, and all round those reeds as far as that
alder, and right up to the mill. Over there, do you see, where the
pools are? That’s the best place. There I once shot seventeen snipe.
We’ll separate with the dogs and go in different directions, and then
meet over there at the mill.
Well, which shall go to left and which to right?
It’s wider to the right; you two go that way and I’ll
take the left,
Capital! we’ll make the bigger bag! Yes, come along, come along!
Veslovsky, beside me, walk beside me!
Oh, I won’t get in your way, don’t trouble about me.
Mind you don’t shoot one another.
Bang! bang!
Well, now let us separate,
Krak, Krak, _apporte_!
Hi, sportsmen!
come and have some lunch with us! Have a drop of
wine!
Come along, it’s all right!
_Qu’est-ce qu’ils disent_?
They invite you to have some vodka. Most likely they’ve been dividing
the meadow into lots. I should have some,
Why do they offer it?
Oh, they’re merry-making. Really, you should join them. You would be
interested.
_Allons, c’est curieux_.
You go, you go, you’ll find the way to the mill!
You come too!
Never fear! You taste
our cake!
Fetch it!
No, I must control myself,
Well? You have been popping away!
How have you got on?
Oh, pretty fair.
A splendid marsh! I’ve no doubt Veslovsky got in your way. It’s
awkward too, shooting with one dog,
I’ve only just come. _Ils ont été charmants_. Just fancy, they gave me
drink, fed me! Such bread, it was exquisite! _Délicieux!_ And the
vodka, I never tasted any better. And they would not take a penny for
anything. And they kept saying: ‘Excuse our homely ways.’
What should they take anything for? They were entertaining you, to be
sure. Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale?
I don’t understand you,
how is it
such people don’t disgust you? I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is
all very pleasant, but don’t you dislike just that very sumptuousness?
All these people, just like our spirit monopolists in old days, get
their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone. They
don’t care for their contempt, and then they use their dishonest gains
to buy off the contempt they have deserved.
Perfectly true!
Perfectly! Oblonsky,
of course, goes out of _bonhomie_, but other people say: ‘Well,
Oblonsky stays with them.’...
Not a bit of it.
I simply don’t consider him more dishonest than any other
wealthy merchant or nobleman. They’ve all made their money alike—by
their work and their intelligence.
Oh, by what work? Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and
speculate with them?
Of course it’s work. Work in this sense, that if it were not for him
and others like him, there would have been no railways.
But that’s not work, like the work of a peasant or a learned
profession.
Granted, but it’s work in the sense that his activity produces a
result—the railways. But of course you think the railways useless.
No, that’s another question; I am prepared to admit that they’re
useful. But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended
is dishonest.
But who is to define what is proportionate?
Making profit by dishonest means, by trickery,
Such as banking, for instance,
It’s an evil—the amassing
of huge fortunes without labor, just the same thing as with the spirit
monopolies, it’s only the form that’s changed. _Le roi est mort, vive
le roi_. No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the
railways came up, and banking companies; that, too, is profit without
work.
Yes, that may all be very true and clever.... Lie down, Krak!
But you have not drawn the
line between honest and dishonest work. That I receive a bigger salary
than my chief clerk, though he knows more about the work than I
do—that’s dishonest, I suppose?
I can’t say.
Well, but I can tell you: your receiving some five thousand, let’s
say, for your work on the land, while our host, the peasant here,
however hard he works, can never get more than fifty roubles, is just
as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk, and Malthus
getting more than a station-master. No, quite the contrary; I see that
society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people, which
is utterly baseless, and I fancy there’s envy at the bottom of it....
No, that’s unfair,
how could envy come in? There is
something not nice about that sort of business.
You say,
that it’s unjust for me to receive five
thousand, while the peasant has fifty; that’s true. It is unfair, and I
feel it, but....
It really is. Why is it we spend our time riding, drinking, shooting,
doing nothing, while they are forever at work?
Yes, you feel it, but you don’t give him your property,
I don’t give it away, because no one demands that from me, and if I
wanted to, I could not give it away,
and have no one
to give it to.
Give it to this peasant, he would not refuse it.
Yes, but how am I to give it up? Am I to go to him and make a deed of
conveyance?
I don’t know; but if you are convinced that you have no right....
I’m not at all convinced. On the contrary, I feel I have no right to
give it up, that I have duties both to the land and to my family.
No, excuse me, but if you consider this inequality is unjust, why is
it you don’t act accordingly?...
Well, I do act negatively on that idea, so far as not trying to
increase the difference of position existing between him and me.
No, excuse me, that’s a paradox.
Yes, there’s something of a sophistry about that,
Ah! our host; so you’re not asleep yet?
How is it you’re not
asleep?
No, how’s one to sleep! I thought our gentlemen would be asleep, but I
heard them chattering. I want to get a hook from here. She won’t bite?
And where are you going to sleep?
We are going out for the night with the beasts.
Ah, what a night!
But listen,
there are women’s voices singing, and, on my word, not badly too. Who’s
that singing, my friend?
That’s the maids from hard by here.
Let’s go, let’s have a walk! We shan’t go to sleep, you know.
Oblonsky, come along!
If one could only do both, lie here and go,
It’s capital lying here.
Well, I shall go by myself,
Good-bye, gentlemen. If it’s fun,
I’ll fetch you. You’ve treated me to some good sport, and I won’t
forget you.
He really is a capital fellow, isn’t he?
Yes, capital,
It’s just this, my dear boy. One must do one of two things: either
admit that the existing order of society is just, and then stick up for
one’s rights in it; or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust
privileges, as I do, and then enjoy them and be satisfied.
No, if it were unjust, you could not enjoy these advantages and be
satisfied—at least I could not. The great thing for me is to feel that
I’m not to blame.
What do you say, why not go after all?
We shan’t go to sleep, you
know. Come, let’s go!
Can it
be that it’s only possible to be just negatively?
How strong the smell of the fresh hay is, though,
There’s not a chance of sleeping. Vassenka
has been getting up some fun there. Do you hear the laughing and his
voice? Hadn’t we better go? Come along!
No, I’m not coming,
Surely that’s not a matter of principle too,
It’s not a matter of principle, but why should I go?
But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself,
How so?
Do you suppose I don’t see the line you’ve taken up with your wife? I
heard how it’s a question of the greatest consequence, whether or not
you’re to be away for a couple of days’ shooting. That’s all very well
as an idyllic episode, but for your whole life that won’t answer. A man
must be independent; he has his masculine interests. A man has to be
manly,
In what way? To go running after servant girls?
Why not, if it amuses him? _Ça ne tire pas à conséquence_. It won’t do
my wife any harm, and it’ll amuse me. The great thing is to respect the
sanctity of the home. There should be nothing in the home. But don’t
tie your own hands.
Perhaps so,
Tomorrow,
early, I want to go shooting, and I won’t wake anyone, and shall set
off at daybreak.
_Messieurs, venez vite!_
_Charmante!_ I’ve made such a discovery. _Charmante!_ a perfect
Gretchen, and I’ve already made friends with her. Really, exceedingly
pretty,
Go to sleep, Vaska; go to sleep, or you’ll
catch it,
Is it really only negative?
Well, what of
it? It’s not my fault.
Tomorrow I’ll go out early, and I’ll make a point of keeping cool.
There are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too. When I come back
there’ll be the note from Kitty. Yes, Stiva may be right, I’m not manly
with her, I’m tied to her apron-strings.... Well, it can’t be helped!
Negative again....
Ah, you do your best to get round her!
Gentlemen, tomorrow before daylight!
Why are you up so early, my dear?
Going shooting, granny. Do I go this way to the marsh?
Straight out at the back; by our threshing floor, my dear, and hemp
patches; there’s a little footpath.
Straight on and you’ll come to the marsh. Our lads drove the cattle
there yesterday evening.
Laska! here?
Fetch it, fetch it!
But I can’t go,
Where am I to go? From here I feel
them, but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or
who they are.
Fetch it, Laska.
Well, if that’s what he wishes, I’ll do it, but I can’t answer for
myself now,
Come, this is going to be some good!
Eh, Laska, will it be good?
Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!
Wait a bit, wait a bit, I know there are nineteen,
I am perfectly well and happy. If you were uneasy about me, you can
feel easier than ever. I’ve a new bodyguard, Marya Vlasyevna,
She has come to have a look at me. She found me perfectly well, and we
have kept her till you are back. All are happy and well, and please,
don’t be in a hurry to come back, but, if the sport is good, stay
another day.
Overdriven yesterday, Konstantin
Dmitrievitch. Yes, indeed! driven ten miles with no sense!
Well, this fellow’s appetite!
I never suffer from loss of appetite,
but he’s really marvelous!...
Well, it can’t be helped,
Well, Philip, give me some beef, then.
The beef’s been eaten, and the bones given to the dogs,
You might have
left me something!
Then put away the game,
and cover them with some nettles. And you
might at least ask for some milk for me.
Excuse our
homely ways,
Well, mind you don’t run after
other men’s wives—you’d better get one of your own.
Altogether, I’ve enjoyed our outing awfully. And you, Levin?
I have, very much,
_Entrez!_
Excuse me, I’ve only just
finished my ablutions,
Don’t mind me, please.
Have you slept
well?
Like the dead. What sort of day is it for shooting?
What will you take, tea or coffee?
Neither. I’ll wait till lunch. I’m really ashamed. I suppose the
ladies are down? A walk now would be capital. You show me your horses.
We had splendid shooting, and so many delightful experiences!
What a
pity ladies are cut off from these delights!
Well, I suppose he must say something to the lady of the house,
I know nothing about it, princess. Do as you think fit,
You must decide when you will move.
I really don’t know. I know millions of children are born away from
Moscow, and doctors ... why....
But if so....
Oh, no, as Kitty wishes.
We can’t talk to Kitty about it! Do you want me to frighten her? Why,
this spring Natalia Golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor.
I will do just what you say,
No, it’s impossible,
You do just as you think best, princess,
Heavy is the cap of Monomach,
How late you are today, Dolly!
I’ve been worried about Masha. She did not sleep well, and is
dreadfully tiresome today,
What do you say, shall we go and look for mushrooms today?
By all means, please, and I shall come too,
Where are you going, Kostya?
The mechanician came when I was away; I haven’t seen him yet,
What do you want?
We are busy.
I beg your pardon,
I want a few
words with my husband.
Don’t disturb yourself.
The train is at three?
I mustn’t be late.
Well, what have you to say to me?
I ... I want to say that we can’t go on like this; that this is
misery....
The servants are here at the sideboard,
don’t make
a scene.
Well, let’s go in here!
Well, come into the garden.
We can’t go on like this! It’s misery! I am wretched; you are
wretched. What for?
But tell me one thing: was there in his tone anything unseemly, not
nice, humiliatingly horrible?
Yes,
but, Kostya, surely you see I’m
not to blame? All the morning I’ve been trying to take a tone ... but
such people.... Why did he come? How happy we were!
And you shall stand all day in the corner, and have your dinner all
alone, and not see one of your dolls, and I won’t make you a new
frock,
Oh, she is a disgusting child!
Where does she
get such wicked propensities?
Why, what has she done?
Grisha and she went into the raspberries, and there ... I can’t tell
you really what she did. It’s a thousand pities Miss Elliot’s not with
us. This one sees to nothing—she’s a machine.... _Figurez-vous que la
petite_?...
That proves nothing; it’s not a question of evil propensities at all,
it’s simply mischief,
But you are upset about something? What have you come for?
What’s going on there?
I’ve not been in there, I’ve been alone in the garden with Kitty.
We’ve had a quarrel for the second time since ... Stiva came.
Come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in Kitty, but in
that gentleman’s behavior, a tone which might be unpleasant—not
unpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?
You mean, how shall I say.... Stay, stay in the corner!
The opinion of the world would be that he is behaving
as young men do behave. _Il fait la cour à une jeune et jolie femme_,
and a husband who’s a man of the world should only be flattered by it.
Yes, yes,
but you noticed it?
Not only I, but Stiva noticed it. Just after breakfast he said to me
in so many words, _Je crois que Veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour à
Kitty_.
Well, that’s all right then; now I’m satisfied. I’ll send him away,
What do you mean! Are you crazy?
nonsense,
Kostya, only think!
You can go now to Fanny,
No, if you wish it, I’ll speak to Stiva. He’ll take him
away. He can say you’re expecting visitors. Altogether he doesn’t fit
into the house.
No, no, I’ll do it myself.
But you’ll quarrel with him?
Not a bit. I shall so enjoy it,
Come, forgive her, Dolly, she won’t do it again,
And what is there in common between us and him?
The spring was broken yesterday,
Well, the covered trap, then, and make haste. Where’s the visitor?
The gentleman’s gone to his room.
You ride in gaiters?
Yes, it’s much cleaner,
I wanted....
I have ordered the horses to be put-to for you.
How so?
To drive where?
For you to drive to the station,
Are you going away, or has something happened?
It happens that I expect visitors,
And
I’m not expecting visitors, and nothing has happened, but I beg you to
go away. You can explain my rudeness as you like.
I beg you to explain....
I can’t explain,
and you’d better not ask.
Can I not see Oblonsky?
What else was there for him to do?
I’ll send him to you at once.
What madness is this?
_Mais c’est ridicule!_ What fly has stung you? _Mais c’est
du dernier ridicule!_ What did you think, if a young man....
Please don’t go into it! I can’t help it. I feel ashamed of how I’m
treating you and him. But it won’t be, I imagine, a great grief to him
to go, and his presence was distasteful to me and to my wife.
But it’s insulting to him! _Et puis c’est ridicule_.
And to me it’s both insulting and distressing! And I’m not at fault in
any way, and there’s no need for me to suffer.
Well, this I didn’t expect of you! _On peut être jaloux, mais à ce
point, c’est du dernier ridicule!_
What’s this?
If only you’d ordered out the carriage! But no! and then I hear:
‘Stop!’ Oh, I thought they’ve relented. I look out, and behold a fat
German being sat down by him and driving away.... And my new shoes all
for nothing!...
What makes you suppose that I dislike your going? But, even if I did
dislike it, I should still more dislike your not taking my horses,
You never told me that you were going for certain. Hiring horses
in the village is disagreeable to me, and, what’s of more importance,
they’ll undertake the job and never get you there. I have horses. And
if you don’t want to wound me, you’ll take mine.
If only Masha does not begin her naughty tricks, if Grisha
isn’t kicked by a horse, and Lily’s stomach isn’t upset again!
The girls are all right,
but the boys?
It’s very well that I’m teaching Grisha, but of course that’s only
because I am free myself now, I’m not with child. Stiva, of course,
there’s no counting on. And with the help of good-natured friends I can
bring them up; but if there’s another baby coming?...
The birth itself, that’s nothing; but the months of carrying the
child—that’s what’s so intolerable,
I had a girl baby, but God set me free; I buried her last Lent.
Well, did you grieve very much for her?
Why grieve? The old man has grandchildren enough as it is. It was only
a trouble. No working, nor nothing. Only a tie.
Yes, altogether,
pregnancy, sickness, mental incapacity, indifference to everything,
and most of all—hideousness. Kitty, young and pretty as she is, even
Kitty has lost her looks; and I when I’m with child become hideous, I
know it. The birth, the agony, the hideous agonies, that last moment
... then the nursing, the sleepless nights, the fearful pains....
Then the
children’s illnesses, that everlasting apprehension; then bringing them
up; evil propensities
education, Latin—it’s all so incomprehensible and
difficult. And on the top of it all, the death of these children.
And all this, what’s it for? What is to come of it all? That I’m
wasting my life, never having a moment’s peace, either with child, or
nursing a child, forever irritable, peevish, wretched myself and
worrying others, repulsive to my husband, while the children are
growing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless. Even now, if it
weren’t for spending the summer at the Levins’, I don’t know how we
should be managing to live. Of course Kostya and Kitty have so much
tact that we don’t feel it; but it can’t go on. They’ll have children,
they won’t be able to keep us; it’s a drag on them as it is. How is
papa, who has hardly anything left for himself, to help us? So that I
can’t even bring the children up by myself, and may find it hard with
the help of other people, at the cost of humiliation. Why, even if we
suppose the greatest good luck, that the children don’t die, and I
bring them up somehow. At the very best they’ll simply be decent
people. That’s all I can hope for. And to gain simply that—what
agonies, what toil!... One’s whole life ruined!
Is it far now, Mihail?
From this village, they say, it’s five miles.
They’re all living, they’re all enjoying
life,
while I, let out, as it were from
prison, from the world of worries that fret me to death, am only
looking about me now for an instant. They all live; those peasant women
and my sister Natalia and Varenka and Anna, whom I am going to see—all,
but not I.

“And they attack Anna. What for? am I any better? I have, anyway, a
husband I love—not as I should like to love him, still I do love him,
while Anna never loved hers. How is she to blame? She wants to live.
God has put that in our hearts. Very likely I should have done the
same. Even to this day I don’t feel sure I did right in listening to
her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow. I ought then
to have cast off my husband and have begun my life fresh. I might have
loved and have been loved in reality. And is it any better as it is? I
don’t respect him. He’s necessary to me,
and I put up with him. Is that any better? At that time I
could still have been admired, I had beauty left me still,
Anna
did quite right, and certainly I shall never reproach her for it. She
is happy, she makes another person happy, and she’s not broken down as
I am, but most likely just as she always was, bright, clever, open to
every impression,
Well, you are slow!
Come along, do!
Vozdvizhenskoe, the manor house? the count’s?
go on to
the end of this track. Then turn to the left. Straight along the avenue
and you’ll come right upon it. But whom do you want? The count
himself?
Well, are they at home, my good man?
At home for sure,
Sure to be at home,
Only
yesterday visitors arrived. There’s a sight of visitors come. What do
you want?
Oh! They all rode by here not long
since, to look at a reaping machine. They’ll be home by now. And who
will you be belonging to?...
We’ve come a long way,
So
it’s not far?
I tell you, it’s just here. As soon as you get out....
What, is it laborers they want for the harvest?
I don’t know, my boy.
So you keep to the left, and you’ll come right on it,
Stop! Hi, friend! Stop!
They’re coming! They’re yonder!
See what a
turn-out!
I thought it was you and dared not think it. How delightful! You can’t
fancy how glad I am!
Here’s a delightful surprise, Alexey!
You wouldn’t believe how glad we are to see you,
That’s Princess Varvara,
Ah!
And I’ll get into this vehicle,
The horse is quiet, and the
princess drives capitally.
No, stay as you were,
and we’ll go in the
carriage,
this vehicle,
They’re pleased, too; haven’t seen each other for a long while,
I say, Uncle Gerasim, if we could take that raven horse now, to cart
the corn, that ’ud be quick work!
Look-ee! Is that a woman in breeches?
Nay, a man! See how smartly he’s going it!
Eh, lads! seems we’re not going to sleep, then?
What chance of sleep today!
Midday’s past, look-ee! Get your hooks, and come along!
You are looking at me,
and wondering how I can be happy in
my position? Well! it’s shameful to confess, but I ... I’m inexcusably
happy. Something magical has happened to me, like a dream, when you’re
frightened, panic-stricken, and all of a sudden you wake up and all the
horrors are no more. I have waked up. I have lived through the misery,
the dread, and now for a long while past, especially since we’ve been
here, I’ve been so happy!...
How glad I am!
I’m very glad for you. Why haven’t you written to
me?
Why?... Because I hadn’t the courage.... You forget my position....
To me? Hadn’t the courage? If you knew how I ... I look at....
But of that we’ll talk later. What’s this, what are all these
buildings?
Quite a little town.
No, no! How do you look at my position, what do you think of it?
I consider....
He’s doing it, Anna
Arkadyevna!
I don’t think anything,
but I always loved you, and if one
loves anyone, one loves the whole person, just as they are and not as
one would like them to be....
If you had any sins,
they would all be forgiven you for
your coming to see me and these words.
Well, what are these buildings? How many there are of them!
These are the servants’ houses, barns, and stables,
And there the park begins. It had all gone to ruin, but Alexey had
everything renewed. He is very fond of this place, and, what I never
expected, he has become intensely interested in looking after it. But
his is such a rich nature! Whatever he takes up, he does splendidly. So
far from being bored by it, he works with passionate interest. He—with
his temperament as I know it—he has become careful and businesslike, a
first-rate manager, he positively reckons every penny in his management
of the land. But only in that. When it’s a question of tens of
thousands, he doesn’t think of money.
Do you see that big building?
that’s the new hospital. I believe it will cost over a hundred
thousand; that’s his hobby just now. And do you know how it all came
about? The peasants asked him for some meadowland, I think it was, at a
cheaper rate, and he refused, and I accused him of being miserly. Of
course it was not really because of that, but everything together, he
began this hospital to prove, do you see, that he was not miserly about
money. _C’est une petitesse_, if you like, but I love him all the more
for it. And now you’ll see the house in a moment. It was his
grandfather’s house, and he has had nothing changed outside.
How beautiful!
Isn’t it fine? And from the house, from the top, the view is
wonderful.
Ah, they’re here already!
It is a nice horse,
isn’t it? It’s my cob; my favorite. Lead him here and bring me some
sugar. Where is the count?
Ah, there he is!
Where are you going to put the princess?
I think the big
balcony room.
Oh, no, that’s too far off! Better in the corner room, we shall see
each other more. Come, let’s go up,
_Et vous oubliez votre devoir_,
_Pardon, j’en ai tout plein les poches_,
_Mais vous venez trop tard_,
You can stay some time? For one day only? That’s
impossible!
I promised to be back, and the children....
No, Dolly, darling!... Well, we’ll see. Come along, come along!
Well, darling, how happy I am!
Tell me about all of you. Stiva I had
only a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one about the children. How is my
favorite, Tanya? Quite a big girl, I expect?
Yes, she’s very tall,
We are
having a delightful stay at the Levins’,
Oh, if I had known,
that you do not despise me!... You
might have all come to us. Stiva’s an old friend and a great friend of
Alexey’s, you know,
Yes, but we are all....
But in my delight I’m talking nonsense. The one thing, darling, is
that I am so glad to have you!
You
haven’t told me yet how and what you think about me, and I keep wanting
to know. But I’m glad you will see me as I am. The chief thing I
shouldn’t like would be for people to imagine I want to prove anything.
I don’t want to prove anything; I merely want to live, to do no one
harm but myself. I have the right to do that, haven’t I? But it is a
big subject, and we’ll talk over everything properly later. Now I’ll go
and dress and send a maid to you.
I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna; my lady’s dearer to me than anything.
Well, it’s not for us to judge. And, to be sure, there seems so much
love....
Kindly pour out the water for me to wash now, please,
Certainly. We’ve two women kept specially for washing small things,
but most of the linen’s done by machinery. The count goes into
everything himself. Ah, what a husband!...
An old friend,
Well, Anna, and how is your little girl?
Annie?
Very
well. She has got on wonderfully. Would you like to see her? Come, I’ll
show her to you. We had a terrible bother,
over nurses. We had an Italian wet-nurse. A good creature, but so
stupid! We wanted to get rid of her, but the baby is so used to her
that we’ve gone on keeping her still.
But how have you managed?...
How did you manage? have you weaned her yet?
You didn’t mean to ask that? You meant to ask about her surname. Yes?
That worries Alexey. She has no name—that is, she’s a Karenina,
But we’ll talk about all that later,
Come, I’ll show you her. _Elle est très gentille_. She
crawls now.
Yes, my lady.
I sometimes feel sorry I’m so superfluous here,
It was very different with my first child.
I expected it to be the other way,
Oh, no! By the way, do you know I saw Seryozha?
But we’ll talk
about that later. You wouldn’t believe it, I’m like a hungry beggar
woman when a full dinner is set before her, and she does not know what
to begin on first. The dinner is you, and the talks I have before me
with you, which I could never have with anyone else; and I don’t know
which subject to begin upon first. _Mais je ne vous ferai grâce de
rien_. I must have everything out with you.
Oh, I ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with
us,
I’ll begin with the ladies. Princess Varvara—you
know her, and I know your opinion and Stiva’s about her. Stiva says the
whole aim of her existence is to prove her superiority over Auntie
Katerina Pavlovna: that’s all true; but she’s a good-natured woman, and
I am so grateful to her. In Petersburg there was a moment when a
chaperon was absolutely essential for me. Then she turned up. But
really she is good-natured. She did a great deal to alleviate my
position. I see you don’t understand all the difficulty of my position
... there in Petersburg,
Here I’m perfectly at ease and
happy. Well, of that later on, though. Then Sviazhsky—he’s the marshal
of the district, and he’s a very good sort of a man, but he wants to
get something out of Alexey. You understand, with his property, now
that we are settled in the country, Alexey can exercise great
influence. Then there’s Tushkevitch—you have seen him, you know—Betsy’s
admirer. Now he’s been thrown over and he’s come to see us. As Alexey
says, he’s one of those people who are very pleasant if one accepts
them for what they try to appear to be, _et puis il est comme il faut_,
as Princess Varvara says. Then Veslovsky ... you know him. A very nice
boy,
What’s this wild
story about him and the Levins? Veslovsky told Alexey about it, and we
don’t believe it. _Il est très gentil et naïf_,
Men need occupation, and Alexey needs a circle, so I
value all these people. We have to have the house lively and gay, so
that Alexey may not long for any novelty. Then you’ll see the steward—a
German, a very good fellow, and he understands his work. Alexey has a
very high opinion of him. Then the doctor, a young man, not quite a
Nihilist perhaps, but you know, eats with his knife ... but a very good
doctor. Then the architect.... _Une petite cour!_
Here’s Dolly for you, princess, you were so anxious to see her,
She
says she doesn’t want anything before dinner, but please order some
lunch for her, and I’ll go and look for Alexey and bring them all in.
Her husband will give her a divorce, and then I shall go back to my
solitude; but now I can be of use, and I am doing my duty, however
difficult it may be for me—not like some other people. And how sweet it
is of you, how right of you to have come! They live like the best of
married couples; it’s for God to judge them, not for us. And didn’t
Biryuzovsky and Madame Avenieva ... and Sam Nikandrov, and Vassiliev
and Madame Mamonova, and Liza Neptunova.... Did no one say anything
about them? And it has ended by their being received by everyone. And
then, _c’est un intérieur si joli, si comme il faut. Tout-à-fait à
l’anglaise. On se réunit le matin au breakfast, et puis on se sépare._
Everyone does as he pleases till dinner time. Dinner at seven o’clock.
Stiva did very rightly to send you. He needs their support. You know
that through his mother and brother he can do anything. And then they
do so much good. He didn’t tell you about his hospital? _Ce sera
admirable_—everything from Paris.
_Une partie de lawn-tennis,_
We’ll be partners again, Anna Arkadyevna.
No, it’s too hot; better stroll about the garden and have a row in the
boat, show Darya Alexandrovna the river banks.
I agree to anything,
I imagine that what Dolly would like best would be a stroll—wouldn’t
you? And then the boat, perhaps,
Yes, it’s a very fine building, and in the good old-fashioned style,
I like so much the court in front of the steps. Was that always so?
Oh, no!
If you could
only have seen that court last spring!
If you would care to look at the hospital, and are not tired, indeed,
it’s not far. Shall we go?
Are you coming, Anna?
We will come, won’t we?
_Mais il ne
faut pas laisser le pauvre Veslovsky et Tushkevitch se morfondre là
dans le bateau._ We must send and tell them.
Yes, this is a monument he is setting up here,
Oh, it’s a work of real importance!
I wonder, though, count,
that while you do so much for the
health of the peasants, you take so little interest in the schools.
_C’est devenu tellement commun les écoles,_
You
understand it’s not on that account, but it just happens so, my
interest has been diverted elsewhere. This way then to the hospital,
How quickly work gets done with you!
When I was here
last time the roof was not on.
By the autumn it will all be ready. Inside almost everything is done,
And what’s this new building?
That’s the house for the doctor and the dispensary,
The front is still too low,
I said the foundation ought to be raised,
Yes, of course it would have been much better, Anna Arkadyevna,
but now it’s too late.
Yes, I take a great interest in it,
This new
building ought to have been in harmony with the hospital. It was an
afterthought, and was begun without a plan.
This is the reception room,
Here there will be a desk,
tables, and benches, and nothing more.
This way; let us go in here. Don’t go near the window,
Alexey, the paint’s dry
already,
Yes, I imagine that this will be the solitary example of a properly
fitted hospital in Russia,
And won’t you have a lying-in ward?
That’s so much
needed in the country. I have often....
This is not a lying-in home, but a hospital for the sick, and is
intended for all diseases, except infectious complaints,
Ah!
look at this,
Look.
The patient can’t walk—still too
weak, perhaps, or something wrong with his legs, but he must have air,
and he moves, rolls himself along....
Yes, he’s a very nice, good man,
No, I think the princess is tired, and horses don’t interest her,
You go on, while I escort
the princess home, and we’ll have a little talk,
if you
would like that?
I know nothing about horses, and I shall be delighted,
You guess that I have something I want to say to you,
I am not wrong in believing you to
be a friend of Anna’s.
He is going to beg me to come to stay with
them with the children, and I shall have to refuse; or to create a set
that will receive Anna in Moscow.... Or isn’t it Vassenka Veslovsky and
his relations with Anna? Or perhaps about Kitty, that he feels he was
to blame?
You have so much influence with Anna, she is so fond of you,
do help me.
You have come to see us, you, the only woman of Anna’s former
friends—I don’t count Princess Varvara—but I know that you have done
this not because you regard our position as normal, but because,
understanding all the difficulty of the position, you still love her
and want to be a help to her. Have I understood you rightly?
Oh, yes,
but....
No,
No one feels more deeply and intensely than
I do all the difficulty of Anna’s position; and that you may well
understand, if you do me the honor of supposing I have any heart. I am
to blame for that position, and that is why I feel it.
I understand,
But just because you
feel yourself responsible, you exaggerate it, I am afraid,
Her position in the world is difficult, I can well understand.
In the world it is hell!
You can’t imagine moral sufferings greater than what she went through
in Petersburg in that fortnight ... and I beg you to believe it.
Yes, but here, so long as neither Anna ... nor you miss society....
Society!
how could I miss society?
So far—and it may be so always—you are happy and at peace. I see in
Anna that she is happy, perfectly happy, she has had time to tell me so
much already,
Yes, yes,
I know that she has revived after all her
sufferings; she is happy. She is happy in the present. But I?... I am
afraid of what is before us ... I beg your pardon, you would like to
walk on?
No, I don’t mind.
Well, then, let us sit here.
I see that she is happy,
But can it
last? Whether we have acted rightly or wrongly is another question, but
the die is cast,
and we are
bound together for life. We are united by all the ties of love that we
hold most sacred. We have a child, we may have other children. But the
law and all the conditions of our position are such that thousands of
complications arise which she does not see and does not want to see.
And that one can well understand. But I can’t help seeing them. My
daughter is by law not my daughter, but Karenin’s. I cannot bear this
falsity!
One day a son may be born, my son, and he will be legally a Karenin;
he will not be the heir of my name nor of my property, and however
happy we may be in our home life and however many children we may have,
there will be no real tie between us. They will be Karenins. You can
understand the bitterness and horror of this position! I have tried to
speak of this to Anna. It irritates her. She does not understand, and
to her I cannot speak plainly of all this. Now look at another side. I
am happy, happy in her love, but I must have occupation. I have found
occupation, and am proud of what I am doing and consider it nobler than
the pursuits of my former companions at court and in the army. And most
certainly I would not change the work I am doing for theirs. I am
working here, settled in my own place, and I am happy and contented,
and we need nothing more to make us happy. I love my work here. _Ce
n’est pas un pis-aller,_ on the contrary....
Well, I will go on,
The great thing is
that as I work I want to have a conviction that what I am doing will
not die with me, that I shall have heirs to come after me,—and this I
have not. Conceive the position of a man who knows that his children,
the children of the woman he loves, will not be his, but will belong to
someone who hates them and cares nothing about them! It is awful!
Yes, indeed, I see that. But what can Anna do?
Yes, that brings me to the object of my conversation,
Anna can, it depends on her.... Even
to petition the Tsar for legitimization, a divorce is essential. And
that depends on Anna. Her husband agreed to a divorce—at that time your
husband had arranged it completely. And now, I know, he would not
refuse it. It is only a matter of writing to him. He said plainly at
that time that if she expressed the desire, he would not refuse. Of
course,
it is one of those Pharisaical cruelties of
which only such heartless men are capable. He knows what agony any
recollection of him must give her, and knowing her, he must have a
letter from her. I can understand that it is agony to her. But the
matter is of such importance, that one must _passer par-dessus toutes
ces finesses de sentiment. Il y va du bonheur et de l’existence d’Anne
et de ses enfants._ I won’t speak of myself, though it’s hard for me,
very hard,
And so it is, princess, that I am
shamelessly clutching at you as an anchor of salvation. Help me to
persuade her to write to him and ask for a divorce.
Yes, of course,
Yes, of
course,
Use your influence with her, make her write. I don’t like—I’m almost
unable to speak about this to her.
Very well, I will talk to her. But how is it she does not think of it
herself?
Just as though she half-shut her
eyes to her own life, so as not to see everything,
Yes, indeed, for my own sake and for hers I will talk to her,
I believe it’s dinner time,
We’ve not seen each other at
all yet. I am reckoning on the evening. Now I want to go and dress. I
expect you do too; we all got splashed at the buildings.
This is all I can do,
Yes, we are too formal here,
Alexey is delighted at your visit, as he rarely is at
anything. He has completely lost his heart to you,
You’re
not tired?
Nikolay Ivanitch was struck,
at the
progress the new building had made since he was here last; but I am
there every day, and every day I wonder at the rate at which it grows.
It’s first-rate working with his excellency,
It’s a very different matter to have to do with the district
authorities. Where one would have to write out sheaves of papers, here
I call upon the count, and in three words we settle the business.
The American way of doing business,
Yes, there they build in a rational fashion....
Have you ever seen a reaping machine?
We had just ridden over to look at one when we met. It’s
the first time I ever saw one.
How do they work?
Exactly like little scissors. A plank and a lot of little scissors.
Like this.
More like little penknives,
Isn’t it true,
Karl Fedoritch, that it’s just like little scissors?
_Oh, ja,_
Es ist ein ganz einfaches Ding,
It’s a pity it doesn’t bind too. I saw one at the Vienna exhibition,
which binds with a wire,
They would be more
profitable in use.
Es kommt drauf an.... Der Preis vom Draht muss ausgerechnet werden.
Das
lässt sich ausrechnen, Erlaucht.
Zu compliziert, macht zu viel Klopot,
Wünscht man Dochots, so hat man auch Klopots,
J’adore l’allemand,
Cessez,
We expected to find you in the fields, Vassily Semyonitch,
have you been there?
I went there, but I had taken flight,
Then you’ve taken a good constitutional?
Splendid!
Well, and how was the old woman? I hope it’s not typhus?
Typhus it is not, but it’s taking a bad turn.
What a pity!
It would be a hard task, though, to construct a machine from your
description, Anna Arkadyevna,
Oh, no, why so?
But Anna Arkadyevna’s knowledge of architecture is marvelous,
To be sure, I heard Anna Arkadyevna talking yesterday about plinths
and damp-courses,
Have I got it right?
There’s nothing marvelous about it, when one sees and hears so much of
it,
But, I dare say, you don’t even know what houses are
made of?
Come now, tell us, Veslovsky, how are the stones held together?
By cement, of course.
Bravo! And what is cement?
Oh, some sort of paste ... no, putty,
I have not the pleasure of knowing this M. Levin,
but most likely he has never seen the machines he condemns;
or if he has seen and tried any, it must have been after a queer
fashion, some Russian imitation, not a machine from abroad. What sort
of views can anyone have on such a subject?
Turkish views, in general,
I can’t defend his opinions,
but
I can say that he’s a highly cultivated man, and if he were here he
would know very well how to answer you, though I am not capable of
doing so.
I like him extremely, and we are great friends,
_Mais pardon, il est un petit peu toqué;_ he
maintains, for instance, that district councils and arbitration boards
are all of no use, and he is unwilling to take part in anything.
It’s our Russian apathy,
we’ve no sense of the
duties our privileges impose upon us, and so we refuse to recognize
these duties.
I know no man more strict in the performance of his duties,
For my part,
such as I am, I am, on the
contrary, extremely grateful for the honor they have done me, thanks to
Nikolay Ivanitch
in electing me a justice
of the peace. I consider that for me the duty of being present at the
session, of judging some peasants’ quarrel about a horse, is as
important as anything I can do. And I shall regard it as an honor if
they elect me for the district council. It’s only in that way I can pay
for the advantages I enjoy as a landowner. Unluckily they don’t
understand the weight that the big landowners ought to have in the
state.
So we can reckon upon you, count, for the coming elections?
But you must come a little beforehand, so as to be on the
spot by the eighth. If you would do me the honor to stop with me.
I rather agree with your _beau-frère_,
though not quite
on the same ground as he,
I’m afraid that we
have too many of these public duties in these latter days. Just as in
old days there were so many government functionaries that one had to
call in a functionary for every single thing, so now everyone’s doing
some sort of public duty. Alexey has been here now six months, and he’s
a member, I do believe, of five or six different public bodies. _Du
train que cela va,_ the whole time will be wasted on it. And I’m afraid
that with such a multiplicity of these bodies, they’ll end in being a
mere form. How many are you a member of, Nikolay Ivanitch?
over twenty, I fancy.
Afterwards, by ourselves, we’ll talk about everything.
I’ve got so much I want to tell you,
Well, what of Kitty?
Tell me the truth, Dolly: isn’t she angry with me?
Angry? Oh, no!
But she hates me, despises me?
Oh, no! But you know that sort of thing isn’t forgiven.
Yes, yes,
But I was not to blame. And who is to blame? What’s the meaning of
being to blame? Could it have been otherwise? What do you think? Could
it possibly have happened that you didn’t become the wife of Stiva?
Really, I don’t know. But this is what I want you to tell me....
Yes, yes, but we’ve not finished about Kitty. Is she happy? He’s a
very nice man, they say.
He’s much more than very nice. I don’t know a better man.
Ah, how glad I am! I’m so glad! Much more than very nice,
But tell me about yourself. We’ve a great deal to talk about. And I’ve
had a talk with....
With Alexey,
I know what you talked about. But I wanted
to ask you directly what you think of me, of my life?
How am I to say like that straight off? I really don’t know.
No, tell me all the same.... You see my life. But you mustn’t forget
that you’re seeing us in the summer, when you have come to us and we
are not alone.... But we came here early in the spring, lived quite
alone, and shall be alone again, and I desire nothing better. But
imagine me living alone without him, alone, and that will be ... I see
by everything that it will often be repeated, that he will be half the
time away from home,
Of course,
of course
I won’t try to keep him by force. I don’t keep him indeed. The races
are just coming, his horses are running, he will go. I’m very glad. But
think of me, fancy my position.... But what’s the use of talking about
it?
Well, what did he talk about with you?
He spoke of what I want to speak about of myself, and it’s easy for me
to be his advocate; of whether there is not a possibility ... whether
you could not....
correct, improve
your position.... You know how I look at it.... But all the same, if
possible, you should get married....
Divorce, you mean?
Do you know, the only woman who came
to see me in Petersburg was Betsy Tverskaya? You know her, of course?
_Au fond, c’est la femme la plus depravée qui existe._ She had an
intrigue with Tushkevitch, deceiving her husband in the basest way. And
she told me that she did not care to know me so long as my position was
irregular. Don’t imagine I would compare ... I know you, darling. But I
could not help remembering.... Well, so what did he say to you?
He said that he was unhappy on your account and his own. Perhaps you
will say that it’s egoism, but what a legitimate and noble egoism. He
wants first of all to legitimize his daughter, and to be your husband,
to have a legal right to you.
What wife, what slave can be so utterly a slave as I, in my position?
The chief thing he desires ... he desires that you should not suffer.
That’s impossible. Well?
Well, and the most legitimate desire—he wishes that your children
should have a name.
What children?
Annie and those to come....
He need not trouble on that score; I shall have no more children.
How can you tell that you won’t?
I shall not, because I don’t wish it.
The doctor told me after my illness....
Impossible!
N’est-ce pas immoral?
Why so? Think, I have a choice between two alternatives: either to be
with child, that is an invalid, or to be the friend and companion of my
husband—practically my husband,
Yes, yes,
For you, for other people,
there may be reason to hesitate; but for me.... You must
consider, I am not his wife; he loves me as long as he loves me. And
how am I to keep his love? Not like this!
I,
did not keep my attraction for Stiva; he left me for others, and the
first woman for whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always
pretty and lively. He deserted her and took another. And can Anna
attract and keep Count Vronsky in that way? If that is what he looks
for, he will find dresses and manners still more attractive and
charming. And however white and beautiful her bare arms are, however
beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls, he
will find something better still, just as my disgusting, pitiful, and
charming husband does.
Do you say that it’s not right? But you must consider,
you forget my position. How can I desire children? I’m not speaking of
the suffering, I’m not afraid of that. Think only, what are my children
to be? Ill-fated children, who will have to bear a stranger’s name. For
the very fact of their birth they will be forced to be ashamed of their
mother, their father, their birth.
But that is just why a divorce is necessary.
What is reason given me for, if I am not to use it to avoid bringing
unhappy beings into the world!
I should always feel I had wronged these unhappy children,
If they are not, at any rate they are not unhappy; while if they are
unhappy, I alone should be to blame for it.
How can
one wrong creatures that don’t exist?
No, I don’t know; it’s not right,
Yes, but you mustn’t forget that you and I.... And besides that,
don’t forget the chief point, that I am not now in the same position
as you. For you the question is: do you desire not to have any more
children; while for me it is: do I desire to have them? And that’s a
great difference. You must see that I can’t desire it in my position.
Then there is all the more reason for you to legalize your position,
if possible,
Yes, if possible,
Surely you don’t mean a divorce is impossible? I was told your husband
had consented to it.
Dolly, I don’t want to talk about that.
Oh, we won’t then,
All I see is that you take too
gloomy a view of things.
I? Not at all! I’m always bright and happy. You see, _je fais des
passions._ Veslovsky....
Yes, to tell the truth, I don’t like Veslovsky’s tone,
Oh, that’s nonsense! It amuses Alexey, and that’s all; but he’s a boy,
and quite under my control. You know, I turn him as I please. It’s just
as it might be with your Grisha.... Dolly!
you say I take too gloomy a view of things. You can’t
understand. It’s too awful! I try not to take any view of it at all.
But I think you ought to. You ought to do all you can.
But what can I do? Nothing. You tell me to marry Alexey, and say I
don’t think about it. I don’t think about it!
I don’t think of it? Not a day, not an
hour passes that I don’t think of it, and blame myself for thinking of
it ... because thinking of that may drive me mad. Drive me mad!
When I think of it, I can’t sleep without morphine. But
never mind. Let us talk quietly. They tell me, divorce. In the first
place, he won’t give me a divorce. He’s under the influence of Countess
Lidia Ivanovna now.
You ought to make the attempt,
Suppose I make the attempt. What does it mean?
It means that I, hating him, but still recognizing
that I have wronged him—and I consider him magnanimous—that I humiliate
myself to write to him.... Well, suppose I make the effort; I do it.
Either I receive a humiliating refusal or consent.... Well, I have
received his consent, say....
I receive his consent, but my ... my son? They won’t
give him up to me. He will grow up despising me, with his father, whom
I’ve abandoned. Do you see, I love ... equally, I think, but both more
than myself—two creatures, Seryozha and Alexey.
It is only those two creatures that I love, and one excludes the
other. I can’t have them together, and that’s the only thing I want.
And since I can’t have that, I don’t care about the rest. I don’t care
about anything, anything. And it will end one way or another, and so I
can’t, I don’t like to talk of it. So don’t blame me, don’t judge me
for anything. You can’t with your pure heart understand all that I’m
suffering.
What are you thinking? What are you thinking about me? Don’t despise
me. I don’t deserve contempt. I’m simply unhappy. If anyone is unhappy,
I am,
I am so glad you like Dolly. You do, don’t you?
Oh, I’ve known her a long while, you know. She’s very good-hearted, I
suppose, _mais excessivement terre-à-terre._ Still, I’m very glad to
see her.
Rolling in wealth they may be, but three pots of oats was all they
gave us. Everything cleared up till there wasn’t a grain left by
cockcrow. What are three pots? A mere mouthful! And oats now down to
forty-five kopecks. At our place, no fear, all comers may have as much
as they can eat.
The master’s a screw,
Well, did you like their horses?
The horses!—there’s no two opinions about them. And the food was good.
But it seemed to me sort of dreary there, Darya Alexandrovna. I don’t
know what you thought,
I thought so too. Well, shall we get home by evening?
Eh, we must!
One has to know Anna and Vronsky—I have got to know him better now—to
see how nice they are, and how touching,
I hope you won’t be dull?
I hope not,
I got a box of books yesterday from
Gautier’s. No, I shan’t be dull.
She’s trying to take that tone, and so much the better,
or else it would be the same thing over and over again.
At first there will be, as this time, something
undefined kept back, and then she will get used to it. In any case I
can give up anything for her, but not my masculine independence,
I tell you what you might try,
go to so-and-so and so-and-so,
It’ll mean some delay,
anyway, but you might try it.
Please tell Marya
Ivanovna my wife is very sorry she couldn’t come to the Home.
I kiss the cross,
Oh, no! He’s an honest man. But those old-fashioned methods of
paternal family arrangements in the management of provincial affairs
must be broken down.
We are placing our forces,
Sergey
Ivanovitch!
One district’s enough, and Sviazhsky’s obviously of the opposition,
Why, Kostya, you here too! I suppose you’re converted, eh?
O sancta simplicitas!
What is it? eh? whom?
No guarantee? whose? what?
They won’t pass
him?
No guarantee?
They won’t let Flerov in?
Eh, because of the
charge against him?
Why, at this rate, they won’t admit anyone. It’s
a swindle!
The law!
liable to be called up for trial.
A ballot! Put it to the vote! No need for more
talking!
A ballot! A ballot! Every nobleman sees it! We shed our blood for our
country!... The confidence of the monarch.... No checking the accounts
of the marshal; he’s not a cashier.... But that’s not the point....
Votes, please! Beastly!...
And one vote may decide the whole question, and one must be serious
and consecutive, if one wants to be of use in public life,
Please come, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
your brother’s
looking for you. They are voting on the legal point.
Where am I to put it?
That is a matter for each man’s own decision,
A hundred and twenty-six for admission! Ninety-eight against!
I have served to the best of my powers with
truth and good faith, I value your goodness and thank you,
Beg pardon, excuse me, please,
So you’re sure to be our marshal again,
It’s not likely,
I’m worn out, I’m old. If there are men younger and more
deserving than I, let them serve.
I’ve brought one, drenched him with water,
He’s all right? he’ll do.
Not too drunk, he won’t fall down?
No, he’s first-rate. If only they don’t give him any more here....
I’ve told the waiter not to give him anything on any account.
He’s such a blackguard! I have told him so, but it makes no
difference. Only think of it! He couldn’t collect it in three years!
Yes, it’s a dirty business, there’s no denying,
How dare he say I had his breeches stolen! Pawned them for drink, I
expect. Damn the fellow, prince indeed! He’d better not say it, the
beast!
But excuse me! They take their stand on the act,
the wife must be registered as noble.
Oh, damn your acts! I speak from my heart. We’re all gentlemen, aren’t
we? Above suspicion.
Shall we go on, your excellency, _fine champagne?_
I always advised Marya Semyonovna to let for a fair rent, for she can
never save a profit,
Very glad to see you! To be sure! I remember you very well. Last year
at our district marshal, Nikolay Ivanovitch’s.
Well, and how is your land doing?
Oh, still just the same, always at a loss,
And how do you come to be in our
province?
Come to take part in our _coup d’état?_
All
Russia’s here—gentlemen of the bedchamber, and everything short of the
ministry.
I ought to own that I don’t very well understand the drift of the
provincial elections,
Why, what is there to understand? There’s no meaning in it at all.
It’s a decaying institution that goes on running only by the force of
inertia. Just look, the very uniforms tell you that it’s an assembly of
justices of the peace, permanent members of the court, and so on, but
not of noblemen.
Then why do you come?
From habit, nothing else. Then, too, one must keep up connections.
It’s a moral obligation of a sort. And then, to tell the truth, there’s
one’s own interests. My son-in-law wants to stand as a permanent
member; they’re not rich people, and he must be brought forward. These
gentlemen, now, what do they come for?
That’s the new generation of nobility.
New it may be, but nobility it isn’t. They’re proprietors of a sort,
but we’re the landowners. As noblemen, they’re cutting their own
throats.
But you say it’s an institution that’s served its time.
That it may be, but still it ought to be treated a little more
respectfully. Snetkov, now.... We may be of use, or we may not, but
we’re the growth of a thousand years. If we’re laying out a garden,
planning one before the house, you know, and there you’ve a tree that’s
stood for centuries in the very spot.... Old and gnarled it may be, and
yet you don’t cut down the old fellow to make room for the flowerbeds,
but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree. You won’t
grow him again in a year,
Well, and how is your land doing?
Oh, not very well. I make five per cent.
Yes, but you don’t reckon your own work. Aren’t you worth something
too? I’ll tell you my own case. Before I took to seeing after the land,
I had a salary of three hundred pounds from the service. Now I do more
work than I did in the service, and like you I get five per cent. on
the land, and thank God for that. But one’s work is thrown in for
nothing.
Then why do you do it, if it’s a clear loss?
Oh, well, one does it! What would you have? It’s habit, and one knows
it’s how it should be. And what’s more,
my son, I must tell you, has
no taste for it. There’s no doubt he’ll be a scientific man. So
there’ll be no one to keep it up. And yet one does it. Here this year
I’ve planted an orchard.
Yes, yes,
that’s perfectly true. I always feel there’s
no real balance of gain in my work on the land, and yet one does it....
It’s a sort of duty one feels to the land.
But I tell you what,
a neighbor of mine, a
merchant, was at my place. We walked about the fields and the garden.
‘No,’ said he, ‘Stepan Vassilievitch, everything’s well looked after,
but your garden’s neglected.’ But, as a fact, it’s well kept up. ‘To my
thinking, I’d cut down that lime-tree. Here you’ve thousands of limes,
and each would make two good bundles of bark. And nowadays that bark’s
worth something. I’d cut down the lot.’
And with what he made he’d increase his stock, or buy some land for a
trifle, and let it out in lots to the peasants,
And he’d make his fortune. But you and I must thank God
if we keep what we’ve got and leave it to our children.
You’re married, I’ve heard?
Yes,
Yes, it’s rather
strange,
So we live without making anything, as though we
were ancient vestals set to keep in a fire.
There are some among us, too, like our friend Nikolay Ivanovitch, or
Count Vronsky, that’s settled here lately, who try to carry on their
husbandry as though it were a factory; but so far it leads to nothing
but making away with capital on it.
But why is it we don’t do like the merchants? Why don’t we cut down
our parks for timber?
Why, as you said, to keep the fire in. Besides that’s not work for a
nobleman. And our work as noblemen isn’t done here at the elections,
but yonder, each in our corner. There’s a class instinct, too, of what
one ought and oughtn’t to do. There’s the peasants, too, I wonder at
them sometimes; any good peasant tries to take all the land he can.
However bad the land is, he’ll work it. Without a return too. At a
simple loss.
Just as we do,
Very, very glad to have met you,
And here we’ve met for the first time since we met at your place,
and we’ve had a good talk too.
Well, have you been attacking the new order of things?
That we’re bound to do.
You’ve relieved your feelings?
Delighted! I believe I’ve had the pleasure of meeting you ... at
Princess Shtcherbatskaya’s,
Yes, I quite remember our meeting,
What are we waiting for now?
For Snetkov. He has to refuse or to consent to stand,
Well, and what has he done, consented or not?
That’s the point, that he’s done neither,
And if he refuses, who will stand then?
Whoever chooses to,
Shall you?
Certainly not I,
Who then? Nevyedovsky?
I certainly shall not, under any circumstances,
Well, you find it exciting too?
It’s something like a race. One might bet on it.
Yes, it is keenly exciting,
And once taking the thing
up, one’s eager to see it through. It’s a fight!
What a capable fellow Sviazhsky is! Sees it all so clearly.
Oh, yes!
How is it that you, living constantly in the country, are not a
justice of the peace? You are not in the uniform of one.
It’s because I consider that the justice of the peace is a silly
institution,
I don’t think so, quite the contrary,
It’s a plaything,
We don’t want justices of the
peace. I’ve never had a single thing to do with them during eight
years. And what I have had was decided wrongly by them. The justice of
the peace is over thirty miles from me. For some matter of two roubles
I should have to send a lawyer, who costs me fifteen.
Oh, this is such an original fellow!
But come along; I think they’re
voting....
I can’t understand,
I can’t understand how anyone can be so
absolutely devoid of political tact. That’s where we Russians are so
deficient. The marshal of the province is our opponent, and with him
you’re _ami cochon_, and you beg him to stand. Count Vronsky, now ...
I’m not making a friend of him; he’s asked me to dinner, and I’m not
going; but he’s one of our side—why make an enemy of him? Then you ask
Nevyedovsky if he’s going to stand. That’s not a thing to do.
Oh, I don’t understand it at all! And it’s all such nonsense,
You say it’s all such nonsense, but as soon as you have anything to do
with it, you make a muddle.
Put it in the right side,
the right side.
Well, now is it over?
It’s only just beginning,
Some other candidate may receive more votes
than the marshal.
How glad I am I heard Koznishev! It’s worth losing one’s dinner. He’s
exquisite! So clear and distinct all of it! There’s not one of you in
the law courts that speaks like that. The only one is Meidel, and he’s
not so eloquent by a long way.
As a candidate for the marshalship of the nobility of the province we
call upon staff-captain Yevgeney Ivanovitch Apuhtin!
Declined!
We call upon the privy councilor Pyotr Petrovitch Bol,
Declined!
Declined.
I told you you weren’t late,
This way, please, Konstantin Dmitrievitch; they are voting.
I can’t stand any more of it,
I told you not to let anyone out!
I let someone in, your excellency!
Mercy on us!
our marshal,
your excellency.
Madame
Nevyedovsky elected by
twenty votes. Congratulations. Tell people.
We must let them share our rejoicing.
our
amiable host.
There’ll be a ball, and you’ll see the belle of the province. Worth
seeing, really.
Not in my line,
From Vozdvizhenskoe by special messenger,
Astonishing! how like he is to the deputy prosecutor Sventitsky,
Annie is very ill, the doctor
says it may be inflammation. I am losing my head all alone. Princess
Varvara is no help, but a hindrance. I expected you the day before
yesterday, and yesterday, and now I am sending to find out where you
are and what you are doing. I wanted to come myself, but thought better
of it, knowing you would dislike it. Send some answer, that I may know
what to do.
He has the right to go away
when and where he chooses. Not simply to go away, but to leave me. He
has every right, and I have none. But knowing that, he ought not to do
it. What has he done, though?... He looked at me with a cold, severe
expression. Of course that is something indefinable, impalpable, but it
has never been so before, and that glance means a great deal,
That glance shows the beginning of indifference.
Well, how is Annie?
Oh, she is better.
And you?
Well, I’m glad,
Well, I’m glad. And are you well?
Never mind,
only let him be here, and so long as he’s
here he cannot, he dare not, cease to love me.
What am I to do? I couldn’t sleep.... My thoughts prevented me. When
he’s here I never take it—hardly ever.
Tell me frankly, you were vexed at getting my letter, and you didn’t
believe me?
Yes,
the letter was so strange. First, Annie ill, and then
you thought of coming yourself.
It was all the truth.
Oh, I don’t doubt it.
Yes, you do doubt it. You are vexed, I see.
Not for one moment. I’m only vexed, that’s true, that you seem somehow
unwilling to admit that there are duties....
The duty of going to a concert....
But we won’t talk about it,
Why not talk about it?
I only meant to say that matters of real importance may turn up. Now,
for instance, I shall have to go to Moscow to arrange about the
house.... Oh, Anna, why are you so irritable? Don’t you know that I
can’t live without you?
If so,
it means that you are
sick of this life.... Yes, you will come for a day and go away, as men
do....
Anna, that’s cruel. I am ready to give up my whole life.
If you go to Moscow, I will go too. I will not stay here. Either we
must separate or else live together.
Why, you know, that’s my one desire. But for that....
We must get a divorce. I will write to him. I see I cannot go on like
this.... But I will come with you to Moscow.
You talk as if you were threatening me. But I desire nothing so much
as never to be parted from you,
If so, it’s a calamity!
Aline-Nadine,
our parliament.
I am very sorry you weren’t there,
Not that you weren’t in
the room ... I couldn’t have been so natural in your presence ... I am
blushing now much more, much, much more,
But that you couldn’t see through a crack.
It’s so wretched to feel that there’s a man almost an enemy whom it’s
painful to meet,
I’m very, very glad.
Go, please, go then and call on the Bols,
I know
you are dining at the club; papa put down your name. But what are you
going to do in the morning?
I am only going to Katavasov,
Why so early?
He promised to introduce me to Metrov. I wanted to talk to him about
my work. He’s a distinguished scientific man from Petersburg,
Yes; wasn’t it his article you were praising so? Well, and after
that?
I shall go to the court, perhaps, about my sister’s business.
And the concert?
I shan’t go there all alone.
No? do go; there are going to be some new things.... That interested
you so. I should certainly go.
Well, anyway, I shall come home before dinner,
Put on your frock coat, so that you can go straight to call on
Countess Bola.
But is it absolutely necessary?
Oh, absolutely! He has been to see us. Come, what is it? You go in,
sit down, talk for five minutes of the weather, get up and go away.
Oh, you wouldn’t believe it! I’ve got so out of the way of all this
that it makes me feel positively ashamed. It’s such a horrible thing to
do! A complete outsider walks in, sits down, stays on with nothing to
do, wastes their time and worries himself, and walks away!
Why, I suppose you used to pay calls before you were married, didn’t
you?
Yes, I did, but I always felt ashamed, and now I’m so out of the way
of it that, by Jove! I’d sooner go two days running without my dinner
than pay this call! One’s so ashamed! I feel all the while that they’re
annoyed, that they’re saying, ‘What has he come for?’
No, they won’t. I’ll answer for that,
Well, good-bye.... Do go,
please.
Kostya, do you know I’ve only fifty roubles left?
Oh, all right, I’ll go to the bank and get some. How much?
No, wait a minute.
Let’s talk about it, it
worries me. I seem to spend nothing unnecessary, but money seems to fly
away simply. We don’t manage well, somehow.
Oh, it’s all right,
I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat, and to borrow an advance on the
mill. We shall have money enough in any case.
Yes, but I’m afraid that altogether....
Oh, it’s all right, all right,
Well, good-bye,
darling.
No, I’m really sorry sometimes that I listened to mamma. How nice it
would have been in the country! As it is, I’m worrying you all, and
we’re wasting our money.
Not at all, not at all. Not once since I’ve been married have I said
that things could have been better than they are....
Truly?
I was positively
forgetting her,
Will it be soon? How do you feel?
I have so often thought so, that now I don’t think about it or know
anything about it.
And you’re not frightened?
Not the least little bit,
Well, if anything happens, I shall be at Katavasov’s.
No, nothing will happen, and don’t think about it. I’m going for a
walk on the boulevard with papa. We’re going to see Dolly. I shall
expect you before dinner. Oh, yes! Do you know that Dolly’s position is
becoming utterly impossible? She’s in debt all round; she hasn’t a
penny. We were talking yesterday with mamma and Arseny
and we determined to send you with him to talk
to Stiva. It’s really unbearable. One can’t speak to papa about it....
But if you and he....
Why, what can we do?
You’ll be at Arseny’s, anyway; talk to him, he will tell what we
decided.
Oh, I agree to everything Arseny thinks beforehand. I’ll go and see
him. By the way, if I do go to the concert, I’ll go with Natalia. Well,
good-bye.
Beauty
has been badly shod and is quite lame,
What does your honor
wish to be done?
Send for the veterinary, there may be a bruise.
And for Katerina Alexandrovna?
Hire a pair for our carriage from the jobmaster,
Yes, sir.
You’re positively a reformed character, I’m glad to see,
I heard the bell
and thought: Impossible that it can be he at the exact time!... Well,
what do you say to the Montenegrins now? They’re a race of warriors.
Why, what’s happened?
Yes, here he’s written almost a book on the natural conditions of the
laborer in relation to the land,
I’m not a
specialist, but I, as a natural science man, was pleased at his not
taking mankind as something outside biological laws; but, on the
contrary, seeing his dependence on his surroundings, and in that
dependence seeking the laws of his development.
That’s very interesting,
What I began precisely was to write a book on agriculture; but
studying the chief instrument of agriculture, the laborer,
I could not help coming to quite unexpected results.
But in what do you see the special characteristics of the Russian
laborer?
in his biological characteristics, so to speak,
or in the condition in which he is placed?
One may easily be led into error in basing any conclusion on the
general vocation of a people,
The
condition of the laborer will always depend on his relation to the land
and to capital.
We are late though,
Yes, there’s a meeting of the Society of Amateurs today in
commemoration of the jubilee of Svintitch,
Pyotr Ivanovitch and I were going. I’ve promised to
deliver an address on his labors in zoology. Come along with us, it’s
very interesting.
Yes, and indeed it’s time to start,
Come with us, and
from there, if you care to, come to my place. I should very much like
to hear your work.
Oh, no! It’s no good yet, it’s unfinished. But I shall be very glad to
go to the meeting.
I say, friends, have you heard? He has handed in the separate report,
Biography.
unpleasantness
unpleasantness
Capital! I was meaning to send to you. How’s Kitty? Sit here, it’s
more comfortable.
Have you
read the last circular in the _Journal de St. Pétersbourg?_ I think
it’s excellent,
That’s what I envy you, that you are able to mix in these interesting
scientific circles,
It’s true I haven’t the time for it.
My official work and the children leave me no time; and then I’m not
ashamed to own that my education has been too defective.
That I don’t believe,
Oh, yes, indeed! I feel now how badly educated I am. To educate my
children I positively have to look up a great deal, and in fact simply
to study myself. For it’s not enough to have teachers, there must be
someone to look after them, just as on your land you want laborers and
an overseer. See what I’m reading
it’s expected of Misha, and it’s so difficult.... Come,
explain to me.... Here he says....
Oh, you’re laughing at it!
On the contrary, you can’t imagine how, when I look at you, I’m always
learning the task that lies before me, that is the education of one’s
children.
Well, there’s nothing for you to learn,
All I know,
is that I have never seen better brought-up
children than yours, and I wouldn’t wish for children better than
yours.
If only they’re better than I! That’s all I desire. You don’t know yet
all the work,
with boys who’ve been left like mine to run
wild abroad.
You’ll catch all that up. They’re such clever children. The great
thing is the education of character. That’s what I learn when I look at
your children.
You talk of the education of character. You can’t imagine how
difficult that is! You have hardly succeeded in combating one tendency
when others crop up, and the struggle begins again. If one had not a
support in religion—you remember we talked about that—no father could
bring children up relying on his own strength alone without that help.
I didn’t know you were here,
Well,
how is Kitty? I am dining with you today. I tell you what, Arseny,
you take the carriage.
He’s spoiling me,
he assures me that our
children are splendid, when I know how much that’s bad there is in
them.
Arseny goes to extremes, I always say,
If you look
for perfection, you will never be satisfied. And it’s true, as papa
says,—that when we were brought up there was one extreme—we were kept
in the basement, while our parents lived in the best rooms; now it’s
just the other way—the parents are in the wash house, while the
children are in the best rooms. Parents now are not expected to live at
all, but to exist altogether for their children.
Well, what if they like it better?
Anyone who didn’t know you would think you
were a stepmother, not a true mother.
No, extremes are not good in anything,
Well, come here, you perfect children,
Oh, Kitty told me to talk to you about Oblonsky,
Yes, yes, maman wants us, _les beaux-frères,_ to attack him,
But why should I?
Well, then, I will attack him,
Come, let us go.
Marvelous!
How are you,
Konstantin Dmitrievitch? Particularly sculpturesque and plastic, so to
say, and richly colored is that passage where you feel Cordelia’s
approach, where woman, _das ewig Weibliche,_ enters into conflict with
fate. Isn’t it?
You mean ... what has Cordelia to do with it?
Cordelia comes in ... see here!
You can’t follow it without that,
These phantoms were so far from being phantoms that they
were positively clinging on the ladder,
Well, go at once then,
perhaps
they’ll not be at home, and then you can come to the meeting to fetch
me. You’ll find me still there.
Perhaps they’re not at home?
At home; please walk in,
How annoying!
What did I come for? What have I to say to them?
How is your wife? Have you been at the concert? We couldn’t go. Mamma
had to be at the funeral service.
Yes, I heard.... What a sudden death!
But she was always in weak health.
Were you at the opera yesterday?
Yes, I was.
Lucca was very good.
Yes, very good,
You are not going to the public meeting? They say it will be very
interesting,
No, I promised my _belle-sœur_ to fetch her from it,
Well, now I think the time has come,
Where is your honor
staying?
Of course I don’t care, but still I feel ashamed and awfully stupid,
I think sending him abroad is much the same as punishing a carp by
putting it into the water,
Your hat, please,
Long time since you’ve been.
The prince put your name down yesterday. Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch is
not here yet.
Ah! why are you late?
How’s Kitty?
All right; they are dining at home, all the three of them.
Ah, ‘Aline-Nadine,’ to be sure! There’s no room with us. Go to that
table, and make haste and take a seat,
Levin, this way!
For you and Oblonsky. He’ll be here directly.
Oblonsky’s always late.
Ah, here he is!
Have you only just come?
Good day. Had some vodka? Well, come along then.
That’s in the same style as, ‘that’s a thing I can’t endure!’ You know
the story?
Ah, that’s exquisite! Another
bottle,
Pyotr Illyitch Vinovsky invites you to drink with him,
Who’s that?
You met him once at my place, don’t you remember? A good-natured
fellow.
Ah! and here they are!
Very glad to meet you,
I looked out for you at the
election, but I was told you had gone away.
Yes, I left the same day. We’ve just been talking of your horse. I
congratulate you,
It was very rapidly run.
Yes; you’ve race horses too, haven’t you?
No, my father had; but I remember and know something about it.
Where have you dined?
We were at the second table, behind the columns.
We’ve been celebrating his success,
It’s his
second Imperial prize. I wish I might have the luck at cards he has
with horses. Well, why waste the precious time? I’m going to the
‘infernal regions,’
That’s Yashvin,
Ah, Princess Marya Borissovna, she’s exquisite!
Well, have we finished?
Let us go.
Well, how do you like our Temple of Indolence?
Come along, come along!
Yes, I wanted to walk about and look at everything. It’s interesting.
Yes, it’s interesting for you. But its interest for me is quite
different. You look at those little old men now,
and imagine that they were _shlupiks_ like that
from their birth up.
How _shlupiks_?
I see you don’t know that name. That’s our club designation. You know
the game of rolling eggs: when one’s rolled a long while it becomes a
_shlupik_. So it is with us; one goes on coming and coming to the club,
and ends by becoming a _shlupik_. Ah, you laugh! but we look out, for
fear of dropping into it ourselves. You know Prince Tchetchensky?
No, I don’t know him.
You don’t say so! Well, Prince Tchetchensky is a well-known figure. No
matter, though. He’s always playing billiards here. Only three years
ago he was not a _shlupik_ and kept up his spirits and even used to
call other people _shlupiks_. But one day he turns up, and our porter
... you know Vassily? Why, that fat one; he’s famous for his _bon
mots_. And so Prince Tchetchensky asks him, ‘Come, Vassily, who’s here?
Any _shlupiks_ here yet?’ And he says, ‘You’re the third.’ Yes, my dear
boy, that he did!
infernal regions,
Prince, please come, we’re ready,
It’s not that she’s dull; but this undefined, this unsettled
position,
Levin,
Levin, don’t go,
This is a true friend of mine—almost my greatest friend,
You have become even closer and dearer to me. And I want you,
and I know you ought, to be friends, and great friends, because you’re
both splendid fellows.
Well, there’s nothing for us now but to kiss and be friends,
I’m very, very glad,
Waiter, a bottle of champagne,
And I’m very glad,
Do you know, he has never met Anna?
And I want above everything to take him to see her. Let us
go, Levin!
Really?
She will be very glad to see you. I should be
going home at once,
but I’m worried about Yashvin, and I
want to stay on till he finishes.
Why, is he losing?
He keeps losing, and I’m the only friend that can restrain him.
Well, what do you say to pyramids? Levin, will you play? Capital!
Get the table ready,
It has been ready a long while,
Well, let us begin.
infernal
Well, let us go to Anna’s, then. At once? Eh? She is at home. I
promised her long ago to bring you. Where were you meaning to spend the
evening?
Oh, nowhere specially. I promised Sviazhsky to go to the Society of
Agriculture. By all means, let us go,
Very good; come along. Find out if my carriage is here,
Oblonsky’s carriage!
How glad I am,
that you should know her! You know Dolly has
long wished for it. And Lvov’s been to see her, and often goes. Though
she is my sister,
I don’t hesitate to
say that she’s a remarkable woman. But you will see. Her position is
very painful, especially now.
Why especially now?
We are carrying on negotiations with her husband about a divorce. And
he’s agreed; but there are difficulties in regard to the son, and the
business, which ought to have been arranged long ago, has been dragging
on for three months past. As soon as the divorce is over, she will
marry Vronsky. How stupid these old ceremonies are, that no one
believes in, and which only prevent people being comfortable!
Well, then their position will be as regular as
mine, as yours.
What is the difficulty?
Oh, it’s a long and tedious story! The whole business is in such an
anomalous position with us. But the point is she has been for three
months in Moscow, where everyone knows her, waiting for the divorce;
she goes out nowhere, sees no woman except Dolly, because, do you
understand, she doesn’t care to have people come as a favor. That fool
Princess Varvara, even she has left her, considering this a breach of
propriety. Well, you see, in such a position any other woman would not
have found resources in herself. But you’ll see how she has arranged
her life—how calm, how dignified she is. To the left, in the crescent
opposite the church!
Phew! how hot it is!
But she has a daughter: no doubt she’s busy looking after her?
I believe you picture every woman simply as a female, _une couveuse,_
If she’s occupied, it must be with her
children. No, she brings her up capitally, I believe, but one doesn’t
hear about her. She’s busy, in the first place, with what she writes. I
see you’re smiling ironically, but you’re wrong. She’s writing a
children’s book, and doesn’t talk about it to anyone, but she read it
to me and I gave the manuscript to Vorkuev ... you know the publisher
... and he’s an author himself too, I fancy. He understands those
things, and he says it’s a remarkable piece of work. But are you
fancying she’s an authoress?—not a bit of it. She’s a woman with a
heart, before everything, but you’ll see. Now she has a little English
girl with her, and a whole family she’s looking after.
Oh, something in a philanthropic way?
Why, you will look at everything in the worst light. It’s not from
philanthropy, it’s from the heart. They—that is, Vronsky—had a trainer,
an Englishman, first-rate in his own line, but a drunkard. He’s
completely given up to drink—delirium tremens—and the family were cast
on the world. She saw them, helped them, got more and more interested
in them, and now the whole family is on her hands. But not by way of
patronage, you know, helping with money; she’s herself preparing the
boys in Russian for the high school, and she’s taken the little girl to
live with her. But you’ll see her for yourself.
Where are they?
In the study.
I am delighted!
I am delighted, delighted,
I have known you
and liked you for a long while, both from your friendship with Stiva
and for your wife’s sake.... I knew her for a very short time, but she
left on me the impression of an exquisite flower, simply a flower. And
to think she will soon be a mother!
Ivan Petrovitch and I settled in Alexey’s study,
just so as
to be able to smoke
How are you feeling today?
Oh, nothing. Nerves, as usual.
Yes, isn’t it extraordinarily fine?
I have never seen a better portrait.
And extraordinarily like, isn’t it?
We were just
talking, Ivan Petrovitch and I, of Vashtchenkov’s last pictures. Have
you seen them?
Yes, I have seen them,
But, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you ... you were saying?...
She was here yesterday. She was very indignant with the high school
people on Grisha’s account. The Latin teacher, it seems, had been
unfair to him.
Yes, I have seen his pictures. I didn’t care for them very much,
I laugh,
as one laughs when one sees a very true portrait.
What you said so perfectly hits off French art now, painting and
literature too, indeed—Zola, Daudet. But perhaps it is always so, that
men form their conceptions from fictitious, conventional types, and
then—all the _combinaisons_ made—they are tired of the fictitious
figures and begin to invent more natural, true figures.
That’s perfectly true,
So you’ve been at the club?
Yes, yes, this is a woman!
Oh, well, but that’s of no interest to anyone,
Please order the tea in the drawing-room,
Well, how did she get through her examination?
Splendidly! She’s a very gifted child and a sweet character.
It will end in your loving her more than your own.
There a man speaks. In love there’s no more nor less. I love my
daughter with one love, and her with another.
I was just telling Anna Arkadyevna,
that if she were
to put a hundredth part of the energy she devotes to this English girl
to the public question of the education of Russian children, she would
be doing a great and useful work.
Yes, but I can’t help it; I couldn’t do it. Count Alexey Kirillovitch
urged me very much
he
urged me to take up the school in the village. I visited it several
times. The children were very nice, but I could not feel drawn to the
work. You speak of energy. Energy rests upon love; and come as it will,
there’s no forcing it. I took to this child—I could not myself say
why.
I quite understand that,
It’s impossible to give
one’s heart to a school or such institutions in general, and I believe
that’s just why philanthropic institutions always give such poor
results.
Yes, yes,
I never could. _Je n’ai pas le cœur assez_
large to love a whole asylum of horrid little girls. _Cela ne m’a
jamais réussi._ There are so many women who have made themselves _une
position sociale_ in that way. And now more than ever,
now when I have such
need of some occupation, I cannot.
I know about you,
that you’re not a
public-spirited citizen, and I have defended you to the best of my
ability.
How have you defended me?
Oh, according to the attacks made on you. But won’t you have some
tea?
Give it to me, Anna Arkadyevna,
It’s well worth taking up.
Oh, no, it’s all so sketchy.
I told him about it,
You shouldn’t have. My writing is something after the fashion of those
little baskets and carving which Liza Mertsalova used to sell me from
the prisons. She had the direction of the prison department in that
society,
and they were miracles of patience, the
work of those poor wretches.
About her divorce,
about Vronsky, and what he’s doing at the club, about me?
Good-bye,
I am very glad _que la glace est rompue._
Tell your wife that I love her as before, and that if she cannot
pardon me my position, then my wish for her is that she may never
pardon it. To pardon it, one must go through what I have gone through,
and may God spare her that.
Certainly, yes, I will tell her....
What a marvelous, sweet and unhappy woman!
Well, didn’t I tell you?
Yes,
an extraordinary woman! It’s not her
cleverness, but she has such wonderful depth of feeling. I’m awfully
sorry for her!
Now, please God, everything will soon be settled. Well, well, don’t be
hard on people in future,
Good-bye; we don’t go the same way.
Well, we must sell it at five and a half if we can’t get more,
It’s
extraordinary how all one’s time is taken up here,
Today, again,
I’ve not been to the court, but today I’ve certainly not had time.
quite the
thing
Well, and what have you been doing?
Well, I’m very glad I met Vronsky. I felt quite at ease and natural
with him. You understand, I shall try not to see him, but I’m glad that
this awkwardness is all over,
We talk about the peasants drinking; I don’t know which
drinks most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on
holidays, but....
Well, and then where did you go?
Stiva urged me awfully to go and see Anna Arkadyevna.
Oh!
I’m sure you won’t be angry at my going. Stiva begged me to, and Dolly
wished it,
Oh, no!
She is a very sweet, very, very unhappy, good woman,
Yes, of course, she is very much to be pitied,
Whom was your letter from?
What? what is it?
You’re in love with that hateful woman; she has bewitched you! I saw
it in your eyes. Yes, yes! What can it all lead to? You were drinking
at the club, drinking and gambling, and then you went ... to her of all
people! No, we must go away.... I shall go away tomorrow.
If I have so much effect on others, on this man, who
loves his home and his wife, why is it _he_ is so cold to me?... not
cold exactly, he loves me, I know that! But something new is drawing us
apart now. Why wasn’t he here all the evening? He told Stiva to say he
could not leave Yashvin, and must watch over his play. Is Yashvin a
child? But supposing it’s true. He never tells a lie. But there’s
something else in it if it’s true. He is glad of an opportunity of
showing me that he has other duties; I know that, I submit to that. But
why prove that to me? He wants to show me that his love for me is not
to interfere with his freedom. But I need no proofs, I need love. He
ought to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in
Moscow. Is this life? I am not living, but waiting for an event, which
is continually put off and put off. No answer again! And Stiva says he
cannot go to Alexey Alexandrovitch. And I can’t write again. I can do
nothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; I hold myself in, I
wait, inventing amusements for myself—the English family, writing,
reading—but it’s all nothing but a sham, it’s all the same as morphine.
He ought to feel for me,
Well, you’ve not been dull?
What a terrible passion it is—gambling!
No, I’ve not been dull; I’ve learned long ago not to be dull. Stiva
has been here and Levin.
Yes, they meant to come and see you. Well, how did you like Levin?
Very much. They have not long been gone. What was Yashvin doing?
He was winning—seventeen thousand. I got him away. He had really
started home, but he went back again, and now he’s losing.
Then what did you stay for?
You told
Stiva you were staying on to get Yashvin away. And you have left him
there.
In the first place, I did not ask him to give you any message; and
secondly, I never tell lies. But what’s the chief point, I wanted to
stay, and I stayed,
Anna, what is it for, why will
you?
Of course you wanted to stay, and you stayed. You do everything you
want to. But what do you tell me that for? With what object?
Does anyone contest your rights? But
you want to be right, and you’re welcome to be right.
For you it’s a matter of obstinacy,
simply obstinacy. For you it’s a question of whether you keep the
upper hand of me, while for me....
If you knew what it is for me! When I
feel as I do now that you are hostile, yes, hostile to me, if you knew
what this means for me! If you knew how I feel on the brink of calamity
at this instant, how afraid I am of myself!
But what are you talking about?
What is it for? Do I seek amusements outside our home? Don’t I avoid
the society of women?
Well, yes! If that were all!
Come, tell me what I ought to do to give you peace of mind? I am ready
to do anything to make you happy,
what wouldn’t I do to save you from distress of any sort,
as now, Anna!
It’s nothing, nothing!
I don’t know myself whether it’s
the solitary life, my nerves.... Come, don’t let us talk of it. What
about the race? You haven’t told me!
how I
feel on the brink of calamity, how afraid I am of myself,
What is it?... what is it?
Kitty! What is it?
Nothing,
I felt unwell,
What? has it begun?
We ought to send....
No, no,
It’s sure to be
nothing. I was rather unwell, only a little. It’s all over now.
nothing,
Kostya, don’t be frightened. It’s all right. But I fancy.... We ought
to send for Lizaveta Petrovna.
Please, don’t be frightened, it’s all right. I’m not a bit afraid,
If not I, who
is to blame for it?
I have sent to mamma. You go quickly to fetch Lizaveta Petrovna ...
Kostya!... Nothing, it’s over.
Well, go now; Pasha’s coming. I am all right.
I’m going for the doctor. They have sent for Lizaveta Petrovna, but
I’ll go on there too. Isn’t there anything wanted? Yes, shall I go to
Dolly’s?
Yes, yes. Do go,
Yes, that is she,
Lord have mercy on us! pardon us! aid us!
Thank God! thank God!
For two hours, then? Not more?
You should let Pyotr
Dmitrievitch know, but don’t hurry him. And get some opium at the
chemist’s.
So you think that it may go on well? Lord have mercy on us and help
us!
he had been up
late, and had given orders not to be waked, but would get up soon.
Don’t be in a hurry or let anything slip,
Pyotr Dmitrievitch, Pyotr Dmitrievitch!
For God’s sake, forgive me! See me as you are. It’s
been going on more than two hours already.
In a minute; in a minute!
For one instant.
In a minute.
Pyotr Dmitrievitch!
These people have no
conscience,
Combing his hair, while we’re dying!
Good morning!
There’s no hurry. Well now?
Oh, you needn’t be in any hurry. You don’t understand, you know. I’m
certain I’m not wanted, still I’ve promised, and if you like, I’ll
come. But there’s no hurry. Please sit down; won’t you have some
coffee?
I know, I know,
I’m a married man myself;
and at these moments we husbands are very much to be pitied. I’ve a
patient whose husband always takes refuge in the stables on such
occasions.
But what do you think, Pyotr Dmitrievitch? Do you suppose it may go
all right?
Everything points to a favorable issue.
So you’ll come immediately?
In an hour’s time.
Oh, for mercy’s sake!
Well, let me drink my coffee, anyway.
The Turks are really getting beaten, though. Did you read yesterday’s
telegrams?
No, I can’t stand it!
So you’ll be with us
in a quarter of an hour.
In half an hour.
On your honor?
Well, my dear Lizaveta Petrovna?
She’s going on well,
persuade her to lie down. She will be
easier so.
Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!
Lord, have mercy on us, and succor us!
Lord, have mercy on us, and help us!
I am worrying
you,
I suppose it must be so,
Don’t go, don’t go! I’m not afraid, I’m not afraid!
Mamma, take my earrings. They bother me. You’re not afraid? Quick,
quick, Lizaveta Petrovna....
Oh, this is awful! I’m dying, I’m dying! Go away!
It’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s all right,
Doctor! What is it? What is it? By God!
It’s the end,
It’s over!
Alive! alive! And a boy too! Set your mind at rest!
Mamma, is it true?
What
is happening with her now? Is she asleep? How is she? What is she
thinking of? Is he crying, my son Dmitri?
Send me word if I can see her,
Very well, in a minute,
I have had a nap, Kostya!
and I am so comfortable
now.
Give him to me,
Give him to me,
Lizaveta Petrovna, and he shall look at him.
To be sure, his papa shall look at him,
Wait
a minute, we’ll make him tidy first,
Don’t be frightened, don’t be frightened!
Give him to me! give him to me!
What are you thinking of, Katerina Alexandrovna, you mustn’t move like
that! Wait a minute. I’ll give him to you. Here we’re showing papa what
a fine fellow we are!
A splendid baby!
Come, that’s enough, that’s enough!
Look, now,
Clearly I’ve been napping, and they’ve overlooked me,
honest
honest
honest
honest
honest
Yes, that’s very true,
that’s very true in
particular cases, but still the principle of our day is freedom.
Yes, but I lay down another principle, embracing the principle of
freedom,
embracing,
I don’t advocate protection for the sake of private interests, but for
the public weal, and for the lower and upper classes equally,
But _they_ cannot grasp that,
_they_ are taken up now with personal interests, and carried away by
phrases.
Oh, by the way,
I wanted to ask you, some
time when you see Pomorsky, to drop him a hint that I should be very
glad to get that new appointment of secretary of the committee of the
amalgamated agency of the southern railways and banking companies.
Of course, I can mention it to him; but what is your reason precisely
for wishing to obtain the appointment?
It’s a good salary, rising to nine thousand, and my means....
Nine thousand!
I consider, and I have embodied my views in a note on the subject,
that in our day these immense salaries are evidence of the unsound
economic _assiette_ of our finances.
But what’s to be done?
Suppose a bank
director gets ten thousand—well, he’s worth it; or an engineer gets
twenty thousand—after all, it’s a growing thing, you know!
I assume that a salary is the price paid for a commodity, and it ought
to conform with the law of supply and demand. If the salary is fixed
without any regard for that law, as, for instance, when I see two
engineers leaving college together, both equally well trained and
efficient, and one getting forty thousand while the other is satisfied
with two; or when I see lawyers and hussars, having no special
qualifications, appointed directors of banking companies with immense
salaries, I conclude that the salary is not fixed in accordance with
the law of supply and demand, but simply through personal interest. And
this is an abuse of great gravity in itself, and one that reacts
injuriously on the government service. I consider....
Yes; but you must agree that it’s a new institution of undoubted
utility that’s being started. After all, you know, it’s a growing
thing! What they lay particular stress on is the thing being carried on
honestly,
honest
Honesty is only a negative qualification,
Well, you’ll do me a great service, anyway,
by putting in a word to Pomorsky—just in the way of conversation....
But I fancy it’s more in Volgarinov’s hands,
Volgarinov has fully assented, as far as he’s concerned,
Now there is something I want to talk about, and you know what it is.
About Anna,
What is it exactly that you want from me?
A definite settlement, Alexey Alexandrovitch, some settlement of the
position. I’m appealing to you
not as an injured husband,
not as a statesman
but simply as a man, and a good-hearted man and a
Christian. You must have pity on her,
That is, in what way precisely?
Yes, pity on her. If you had seen her as I have!—I have been spending
all the winter with her—you would have pity on her. Her position is
awful, simply awful!
I had imagined,
that Anna Arkadyevna had everything she had desired for
herself.
Oh, Alexey Alexandrovitch, for heaven’s sake, don’t let us indulge in
recriminations! What is past is past, and you know what she wants and
is waiting for—divorce.
But I believe Anna Arkadyevna refuses a divorce, if I make it a
condition to leave me my son. I replied in that sense, and supposed
that the matter was ended. I consider it at an end,
But, for heaven’s sake, don’t get hot!
The matter is not ended. If you
will allow me to recapitulate, it was like this: when you parted, you
were as magnanimous as could possibly be; you were ready to give her
everything—freedom, divorce even. She appreciated that. No, don’t think
that. She did appreciate it—to such a degree that at the first moment,
feeling how she had wronged you, she did not consider and could not
consider everything. She gave up everything. But experience, time, have
shown that her position is unbearable, impossible.
The life of Anna Arkadyevna can have no interest for me,
Allow me to disbelieve that,
Her
position is intolerable for her, and of no benefit to anyone whatever.
She has deserved it, you will say. She knows that and asks you for
nothing; she says plainly that she dare not ask you. But I, all of us,
her relatives, all who love her, beg you, entreat you. Why should she
suffer? Who is any the better for it?
Excuse me, you seem to put me in the position of the guilty party,
Oh, no, oh, no, not at all! please understand me,
All I say is this:
her position is intolerable, and it might be alleviated by you, and you
will lose nothing by it. I will arrange it all for you, so that you’ll
not notice it. You did promise it, you know.
The promise was given before. And I had supposed that the question of
my son had settled the matter. Besides, I had hoped that Anna
Arkadyevna had enough generosity....
She leaves it all to your generosity. She begs, she implores one thing
of you—to extricate her from the impossible position in which she is
placed. She does not ask for her son now. Alexey Alexandrovitch, you
are a good man. Put yourself in her position for a minute. The question
of divorce for her in her position is a question of life and death. If
you had not promised it once, she would have reconciled herself to her
position, she would have gone on living in the country. But you
promised it, and she wrote to you, and moved to Moscow. And here she’s
been for six months in Moscow, where every chance meeting cuts her to
the heart, every day expecting an answer. Why, it’s like keeping a
condemned criminal for six months with the rope round his neck,
promising him perhaps death, perhaps mercy. Have pity on her, and I
will undertake to arrange everything. _Vos scrupules_....
I am not talking about that, about that....
But, perhaps, I promised what I had no right
to promise.
So you go back from your promise?
I have never refused to do all that is possible, but I want time to
consider how much of what I promised is possible.
No, Alexey Alexandrovitch!
I won’t
believe that! She’s unhappy as only an unhappy woman can be, and you
cannot refuse in such....
As much of what I promised as is possible. _Vous professez d’être
libre penseur._ But I as a believer cannot, in a matter of such
gravity, act in opposition to the Christian law.
But in Christian societies and among us, as far as I’m aware, divorce
is allowed,
Divorce is sanctioned even by
our church. And we see....
It is allowed, but not in the sense....
Alexey Alexandrovitch, you are not like yourself,
Wasn’t it you (and didn’t we all appreciate it in
you?) who forgave everything, and moved simply by Christian feeling was
ready to make any sacrifice? You said yourself: if a man take thy coat,
give him thy cloak also, and now....
I beg,
I beg you to drop this
... to drop ... this subject!
Oh, no! Oh, forgive me, forgive me if I have wounded you,
but
like a messenger I have simply performed the commission given me.
I must think it over and seek for guidance. The day after tomorrow I
will give you a final answer,
Sergey Alexyevitch!
Who’s Sergey Alexyevitch?
Ah, Seryozha!
Sergey Alexyevitch! I thought it was
the director of a department. Anna asked me to see him too,
Anyway, you will see him. Find out exactly where he
is, who is looking after him. And Stiva ... if it were possible! Could
it be possible?
if it
were possible,
He was very ill after that interview with his mother, which we had not
foreseen,
Indeed, we feared for his life.
But with rational treatment, and sea-bathing in the summer, he regained
his strength, and now, by the doctor’s advice, I have let him go to
school. And certainly the companionship of school has had a good effect
on him, and he is perfectly well, and making good progress.
What a fine fellow he’s grown! He’s not Seryozha now, but quite
full-fledged Sergey Alexyevitch!
Well, that’s very fair,
you can go.
He’s thinner and taller, and has grown out of being a child into a
boy; I like that,
Do you remember me?
Yes, _mon oncle_,
Well, and how are you getting on?
We have a railway now,
It’s like this, do you see: two sit on a bench—they’re the passengers;
and one stands up straight on the bench. And all are harnessed to it by
their arms or by their belts, and they run through all the rooms—the
doors are left open beforehand. Well, and it’s pretty hard work being
the conductor!
That’s the one that stands?
Yes, you want pluck for it, and cleverness too, especially when they
stop all of a sudden, or someone falls down.
Yes, that must be a serious matter,
Do you remember your mother?
No, I don’t,
What is it? I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down?
I told you it was a dangerous game. And we shall have to speak
to the director.
If I had hurt myself, nobody should have found it out, that’s
certain.
Well, what is it, then?
Leave me alone! If I remember, or if I don’t remember?... what
business is it of his? Why should I remember? Leave me in peace!
You’re friendly, I fancy, with Mordvinsky; you might do me a favor:
say a word to him, please, for me. There’s an appointment I should like
to get—secretary of the agency....
Oh, I shan’t remember all that, if you tell it to me.... But what
possesses you to have to do with railways and Jews?... Take it as you
will, it’s a low business.
growing
thing
I want the money, I’ve nothing to live on.
You’re living, aren’t you?
Yes, but in debt.
Are you, though? Heavily?
Very heavily: twenty thousand.
Oh, lucky fellow!
My debts mount up to a million and a
half, and I’ve nothing, and still I can live, as you see!
We don’t know the way to live here,
I spent the
summer in Baden, and you wouldn’t believe it, I felt quite a young man.
At a glimpse of a pretty woman, my thoughts.... One dines and drinks a
glass of wine, and feels strong and ready for anything. I came home to
Russia—had to see my wife, and, what’s more, go to my country place;
and there, you’d hardly believe it, in a fortnight I’d got into a
dressing gown and given up dressing for dinner. Needn’t say I had no
thoughts left for pretty women. I became quite an old gentleman. There
was nothing left for me but to think of my eternal salvation. I went
off to Paris—I was as right as could be at once.
Ah, so you’re here!
Well, and what news
of your poor sister? You needn’t look at me like that,
Ever since they’ve all turned against her, all those who’re a thousand
times worse than she, I’ve thought she did a very fine thing. I can’t
forgive Vronsky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg. I’d
have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere. Please give
her my love. Come, tell me about her.
Yes, her position is very difficult; she....
tell me about her.
She’s done what they all do, except me—only they hide it. But she
wouldn’t be deceitful, and she did a fine thing. And she did better
still in throwing up that crazy brother-in-law of yours. You must
excuse me. Everybody used to say he was so clever, so very clever; I
was the only one that said he was a fool. Now that he’s so thick with
Lidia Ivanovna and Landau, they all say he’s crazy, and I should prefer
not to agree with everybody, but this time I can’t help it.
Oh, do please explain,
what does it mean?
Yesterday I was seeing him on my sister’s behalf, and I asked him to
give me a final answer. He gave me no answer, and said he would think
it over. But this morning, instead of an answer, I received an
invitation from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for this evening.
Ah, so that’s it, that’s it!
they’re going to ask Landau what he’s to say.
Ask Landau? What for? Who or what’s Landau?
What! you don’t know Jules Landau, _le fameux Jules Landau, le
clairvoyant_? He’s crazy too, but on him your sister’s fate depends.
See what comes of living in the provinces—you know nothing about
anything. Landau, do you see, was a _commis_ in a shop in Paris, and he
went to a doctor’s; and in the doctor’s waiting room he fell asleep,
and in his sleep he began giving advice to all the patients. And
wonderful advice it was! Then the wife of Yury Meledinsky—you know, the
invalid?—heard of this Landau, and had him to see her husband. And he
cured her husband, though I can’t say that I see he did him much good,
for he’s just as feeble a creature as ever he was, but they believed in
him, and took him along with them and brought him to Russia. Here
there’s been a general rush to him, and he’s begun doctoring everyone.
He cured Countess Bezzubova, and she took such a fancy to him that she
adopted him.
Adopted him?
Yes, as her son. He’s not Landau any more now, but Count Bezzubov.
That’s neither here nor there, though; but Lidia—I’m very fond of her,
but she has a screw loose somewhere—has lost her heart to this Landau
now, and nothing is settled now in her house or Alexey Alexandrovitch’s
without him, and so your sister’s fate is now in the hands of Landau,
_alias_ Count Bezzubov.
Who else is with the countess?—a Frenchman?
Alexey Alexandrovitch Karenin and Count Bezzubov,
Princess Myakaya guessed right,
Curious! It would be quite as well, though, to get on
friendly terms with her. She has immense influence. If she would say a
word to Pomorsky, the thing would be a certainty.
Monsieur Landau!
I am very glad to see you, particularly today,
I introduced you to him as Landau,
but he is really Count Bezzubov, as you’re probably aware. Only he
does not like the title.
Yes, I heard so,
they say he
completely cured Countess Bezzubova.
She was here today, poor thing!
This separation is awful for her. It’s such a blow to
her!
And he positively is going?
Yes, he’s going to Paris. He heard a voice yesterday,
Ah, a voice!
I’ve known you for a long while, and am very glad to make a closer
acquaintance with you. _Les amis de nos amis sont nos amis._ But to be
a true friend, one must enter into the spiritual state of one’s friend,
and I fear that you are not doing so in the case of Alexey
Alexandrovitch. You understand what I mean?
In part, countess, I understand the position of Alexey
Alexandrovitch....
The change is not in his external position,
his heart is
changed, a new heart has been vouchsafed him, and I fear you don’t
fully apprehend the change that has taken place in him.
Oh, well, in general outlines I can conceive the change. We have
always been friendly, and now....
The change that has taken place in him cannot lessen his love for his
neighbors; on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his
heart. But I am afraid you do not understand me. Won’t you have some
tea?
Not quite, countess. Of course, his misfortune....
Yes, a misfortune which has proved the highest happiness, when his
heart was made new, was filled full of it,
I do believe I might ask her to speak to both of them,
Oh, of course, countess,
but I imagine such changes are a
matter so private that no one, even the most intimate friend, would
care to speak of them.
On the contrary! We ought to speak freely and help one another.
Yes, undoubtedly so, but there is such a difference of convictions,
and besides....
There can be no difference where it is a question of holy truth.
Oh, no, of course; but....
I fancy he will fall asleep immediately,
Don’t take any notice,
I have observed....
I have observed,
that Moscow
people, especially the men, are more indifferent to religion than
anyone.
Oh, no, countess, I thought Moscow people had the reputation of being
the firmest in the faith,
But as far as I can make out, you are unfortunately one of the
indifferent ones,
How anyone can be indifferent!
I am not so much indifferent on that subject as I am waiting in
suspense,
I hardly think that the time for such questions has come yet for me.
We can never tell whether the time has come for us or not,
We ought not to think whether we are
ready or not ready. God’s grace is not guided by human considerations:
sometimes it comes not to those that strive for it, and comes to those
that are unprepared, like Saul.
No, I believe it won’t be just yet,
Do you allow me to listen?
Oh, yes; I did not want to disturb you,
sit here with us.
One has only not to close one’s eyes to shut out the light,
Ah, if you knew the happiness we know, feeling His presence ever in
our hearts!
But a man may feel himself unworthy sometimes to rise to that height,
That is, you mean that sin keeps him back?
But
that is a false idea. There is no sin for believers, their sin has been
atoned for. _Pardon,_
Tomorrow at the Grand Duchess’s, say.
For the believer sin is not,
Yes, but faith without works is dead,
There you have it—from the epistle of St. James,
What harm has been done by the false
interpretation of that passage! Nothing holds men back from belief like
that misinterpretation. ‘I have not works, so I cannot believe,’ though
all the while that is not said. But the very opposite is said.
Striving for God, saving the soul by fasting,
those are the crude ideas of our
monks.... Yet that is nowhere said. It is far simpler and easier,
We are saved by Christ who suffered for us. We are saved by faith,
Vous comprenez l’anglais?
I want to read him ‘Safe and Happy,’ or ‘Under the Wing,’
It’s very short. In it is described
the way by which faith can be reached, and the happiness, above all
earthly bliss, with which it fills the soul. The believer cannot be
unhappy because he is not alone. But you will see.
Madame
Borozdina? Tell her, tomorrow at two o’clock. Yes,
that is how true faith acts. You know Marie Sanina?
You know about her trouble? She lost her only child. She was in
despair. And what happened? She found this comforter, and she thanks
God now for the death of her child. Such is the happiness faith
brings!
Oh, yes, that is most....
No,
I see I’d better not ask her about anything today,
If
only I can get out of this without putting my foot in it!
It will be dull for you,
you don’t know English, but it’s short.
Oh, I shall understand,
Marie Sanina
is glad her child’s dead.... How good a smoke would be now!... To be
saved, one need only believe, and the monks don’t know how the thing’s
to be done, but Countess Lidia Ivanovna does know.... And why is my
head so heavy? Is it the cognac, or all this being so queer? Anyway, I
fancy I’ve done nothing unsuitable so far. But anyway, it won’t do to
ask her now. They say they make one say one’s prayers. I only hope they
won’t make me! That’ll be too imbecile. And what stuff it is she’s
reading! but she has a good accent. Landau—Bezzubov—what’s he Bezzubov
for?
he’s asleep.

I don’t expect you to understand me, my
feelings, as anyone who loved me might, but simple delicacy I did
expect,
I feel no interest in your infatuation over this girl, that’s true,
because I see it’s unnatural.
I am very sorry that nothing but what’s coarse and material is
comprehensible and natural to you,
I am myself to blame. I’m irritable, I’m insanely jealous. I will make
it up with him, and we’ll go away to the country; there I shall be more
at peace.
Unnatural!
I know what he meant; he meant—unnatural, not loving my
own daughter, to love another person’s child. What does he know of love
for children, of my love for Seryozha, whom I’ve sacrificed for him?
But that wish to wound me! No, he loves another woman, it must be so.
Can it be impossible? Can it be beyond me to control myself?
He’s
truthful, he’s honest, he loves me. I love him, and in a few days the
divorce will come. What more do I want? I want peace of mind and trust,
and I will take the blame on myself. Yes, now when he comes in, I will
tell him I was wrong, though I was not wrong, and we will go away
tomorrow.
Well, was it nice?
Just as usual,
What do I see? Come, that’s good!
Yes, we must go. I went out for a drive, and it was so fine I longed
to be in the country. There’s nothing to keep you, is there?
It’s the one thing I desire. I’ll be back directly, and we’ll talk it
over; I only want to change my coat. Order some tea.
Come, that’s
good,
You know it came to me almost like an inspiration,
Why
wait here for the divorce? Won’t it be just the same in the country? I
can’t wait any longer! I don’t want to go on hoping, I don’t want to
hear anything about the divorce. I have made up my mind it shall not
have any more influence on my life. Do you agree?
Oh, yes!
What did you do? Who was there?
The dinner was first rate,
and the boat race, and it was all pleasant enough, but in Moscow they
can never do anything without something _ridicule_. A lady of a sort
appeared on the scene, teacher of swimming to the Queen of Sweden, and
gave us an exhibition of her skill.
How? did she swim?
In an absurd red _costume de natation;_ she was old and hideous too.
So when shall we go?
What an absurd fancy! Why, did she swim in some special way, then?
There was absolutely nothing in it. That’s just what I say, it was
awfully stupid. Well, then, when do you think of going?
When? Why, the sooner the better! By tomorrow we shan’t be ready. The
day after tomorrow.
Yes ... oh, no, wait a minute! The day after tomorrow’s Sunday, I have
to be at maman’s,
Can’t you go tomorrow?
Well, no! The deeds and the money for the business I’m going there for
I can’t get by tomorrow,
If so, we won’t go at all.
But why so?
I shall not go later. Monday or never!
What for?
Why, there’s no
meaning in it!
There’s no meaning in it to you, because you care nothing for me. You
don’t care to understand my life. The one thing that I cared for here
was Hannah. You say it’s affectation. Why, you said yesterday that I
don’t love my daughter, that I love this English girl, that it’s
unnatural. I should like to know what life there is for me that could
be natural!
I never said that; I said I did not sympathize with this sudden
passion.
How is it, though you boast of your straightforwardness, you don’t
tell the truth?
I never boast, and I never tell lies,
It’s a great pity if you can’t respect....
Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be.
And if you don’t love me any more, it would be better and more honest
to say so.
No, this is becoming unbearable!
What do you try my patience for?
It has limits.
What do you mean by that?
I mean to say....
I must
ask what it is you want of me?
What can I want? All I can want is that you should not desert me, as
you think of doing,
But that I don’t want; that’s secondary. I want love, and there is
none. So then all is over.
Stop! sto-op!
What is it all about? I said
that we must put off going for three days, and on that you told me I
was lying, that I was not an honorable man.
Yes, and I repeat that the man who reproaches me with having
sacrificed everything for me,
that he’s worse than a dishonorable man—he’s a
heartless man.
Oh, there are limits to endurance!
He hates me, that’s clear,
He
loves another woman, that’s even clearer,
I want love, and there is none. So, then, all
is over.
and it must be ended.
But how?
Why didn’t I die?
Yes, to die!... And the
shame and disgrace of Alexey Alexandrovitch and of Seryozha, and my
awful shame, it will all be saved by death. To die! and he will feel
remorse; will be sorry; will love me; he will suffer on my account.
Anna, we’ll go the day after tomorrow, if you like. I agree to
everything.
What is it?
You know,
Cast me off!
I’ll go away tomorrow
... I’ll do more. What am I? An immoral woman! A stone round your neck.
I don’t want to make you wretched, I don’t want to! I’ll set you free.
You don’t love me; you love someone else!
Anna, why distress yourself and me so?
I’m going off at once to see maman; she can send me the money by
Yegorov. And I shall be ready to go tomorrow,
No, I shan’t be ready by then myself,
so then it was possible to arrange to do as I wished.
No,
do as you meant to do. Go into the dining-room, I’m coming directly.
It’s only to turn out those things that aren’t wanted,
You wouldn’t believe how distasteful these rooms have become to me,
There’s nothing more
awful than these _chambres garnies_. There’s no individuality in them,
no soul. These clocks, and curtains, and, worst of all, the
wallpapers—they’re a nightmare. I think of Vozdvizhenskoe as the
promised land. You’re not sending the horses off yet?
No, they will come after us. Where are you going to?
I wanted to go to Wilson’s to take some dresses to her. So it’s really
to be tomorrow?
By tomorrow, without fail, I will finish it all.
From whom is the telegram?
From Stiva,
Why didn’t you show it to me? What secret can there be between Stiva
and me?
I didn’t want to show it to you, because Stiva has such a passion for
telegraphing: why telegraph when nothing is settled?
About the divorce?
Yes; but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet. He has
promised a decisive answer in a day or two. But here it is; read it.
Little hope; but I will do everything
possible and impossible.
I said yesterday that it’s absolutely nothing to me when I get, or
whether I never get, a divorce,
There was
not the slightest necessity to hide it from me.
So he may hide and
does hide his correspondence with women from me,
Yashvin meant to come this morning with Voytov,
I
believe he’s won from Pyevtsov all and more than he can pay, about
sixty thousand.
No,
why did you suppose that this news
would affect me so, that you must even try to hide it? I said I don’t
want to consider it, and I should have liked you to care as little
about it as I do.
I care about it because I like definiteness,
Definiteness is not in the form but the love,
What do you want it for?
My God! love again,
Oh, you know what for; for your sake and your children’s in the
future.
There won’t be children in the future.
That’s a great pity,
You want it for the children’s sake, but you don’t think of me?
_For your
sake_ and the children’s.
Oh, I said: for your sake. Above all for your sake,
because I am certain that the greater part
of your irritability comes from the indefiniteness of the position.
Yes, now he has laid aside all pretense, and all his cold hatred for
me is apparent,
The cause is not that,
and, indeed, I don’t see how the
cause of my irritability, as you call it, can be that I am completely
in your power. What indefiniteness is there in the position? on the
contrary....
I am very sorry that you don’t care to understand,
The
indefiniteness consists in your imagining that I am free.
On that score you can set your mind quite at rest,
I don’t care in the least what your mother thinks, and what match she
wants to make for you,
But we are not talking about that.
Yes, that’s just what we are talking about. And let me tell you that a
heartless woman, whether she’s old or not old, your mother or anyone
else, is of no consequence to me, and I would not consent to know her.
Anna, I beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother.
A woman whose heart does not tell her where her son’s happiness and
honor lie has no heart.
I repeat my request that you will not speak disrespectfully of my
mother, whom I respect,
There, just such caresses he has
lavished, and will lavish, and longs to lavish on other women!
You don’t love your mother. That’s all talk, and talk, and talk!
Even if so, you must....
Must decide, and I have decided,
Well, how are you getting on? Has your debt been paid you?
Oh, pretty fair; I fancy I shan’t get it all, but I shall get a good
half. And when are you off?
The day after tomorrow, I think,
You’ve been meaning to go so long, though.
But now it’s quite decided,
Don’t you feel sorry for that unlucky Pyevtsov?
I’ve never asked myself the question, Anna Arkadyevna, whether I’m
sorry for him or not. You see, all my fortune’s here
and just now I’m a wealthy man. But today I’m going to
the club, and I may come out a beggar. You see, whoever sits down to
play with me—he wants to leave me without a shirt to my back, and so do
I him. And so we fight it out, and that’s the pleasure of it.
Well, but suppose you were married,
how would it be for
your wife?
That’s why I’m not married, and never mean to be.
And Helsingfors?
It’s not forgotten. It’s all the same.
Were you really in love?
Oh heavens! ever so many times! But you see, some men can play but
only so that they can always lay down their cards when the hour of a
_rendezvous_ comes, while I can take up love, but only so as not to be
late for my cards in the evening. That’s how I manage things.
No, I didn’t mean that, but the real thing.
What do you want?
To get the guarantee for Gambetta, I’ve sold him,
I’ve no time for discussing
things, and it would lead to nothing.
I’m not to blame in any way,
If she will punish herself,
_tant pis pour elle._ But as he was going he fancied that she said
something, and his heart suddenly ached with pity for her.

“Eh, Anna?
I said nothing,
Oh, nothing, _tant pis_ then,
I won’t prevent you,
You can go where you like. You
were unwilling to be divorced from your husband, no doubt so that you
might go back to him. Go back to him. If you want money, I’ll give it
to you. How many roubles do you want?
But didn’t he only yesterday swear he loved me, he, a truthful and
sincere man? Haven’t I despaired for nothing many times already?
If he comes in spite of what
the maid says, it means that he loves me still. If not, it means that
all is over, and then I will decide what I’m to do!...
How could I say
such cruel things to her?
How could I go out of the
room without saying anything to her? But now she is no more. She has
gone away from us forever. She is....
Death!
No, anything—only to live! Why, I
love him! Why, he loves me! This has been before and will pass,
There was a quarrel. Just what has happened several times. I said I
had a headache, and he did not come in to see me. Tomorrow we’re going
away; I must see him and get ready for the journey,
That was Madame Sorokina and her daughter. They came and brought me
the money and the deeds from maman. I couldn’t get them yesterday. How
is your head, better?
Oh, by the way,
we’re going tomorrow for certain, aren’t we?
You, but not I,
Anna, we can’t go on like this....
You, but not I,
This is getting unbearable!
You ... you will be sorry for this,
I’ve tried
everything,
the only thing left is not to pay attention,
He has gone! It is over!
No, that cannot be!
Inquire where the count has gone,
His honor left word that if you cared to drive out, the carriage would
be back immediately.
Very good. Wait a minute. I’ll write a note at once. Send Mihail with
the note to the stables. Make haste.
I was wrong. Come back home; I must explain. For God’s sake come! I’m
afraid.
Why, this isn’t it, this isn’t he! Where are his blue eyes, his sweet,
shy smile?
Can it be
all over? No, it cannot be!
He will come back. But how
can he explain that smile, that excitement after he had been talking to
her? But even if he doesn’t explain, I will believe. If I don’t
believe, there’s only one thing left for me, and I can’t.
By now he has
received the note and is coming back. Not long, ten minutes more....
But what if he doesn’t come? No, that cannot be. He mustn’t see me with
tear-stained eyes. I’ll go and wash. Yes, yes; did I do my hair or
not?
Yes, my hair has been done, but when I did it I can’t
in the least remember.
Who’s that?
Why, it’s I!
What is it? Why, I’m going out of my mind!
Annushka,
You meant to go and see Darya Alexandrovna,
Darya Alexandrovna? Yes, I’ll go.
Fifteen minutes there, fifteen minutes back. He’s coming, he’ll be
here soon.
But how could he
go away, leaving me in such a state? How can he live, without making it
up with me?
We didn’t catch the count. The count had driven off on the lower city
road.
What do you say? What!...
Why, then, he has never received it!
Go with this note to Countess Vronskaya’s place, you know? and bring
an answer back immediately,
And I, what am I going to do?
Yes, I’m going to
Dolly’s, that’s true or else I shall go out of my mind. Yes, and I can
telegraph, too.
I absolutely must talk to
you; come at once.
Annushka, dear, what am I to do?
Why fret yourself so, Anna Arkadyevna? Why, there’s nothing out of the
way. You drive out a little, and it’ll cheer you up,
Yes, I’m going,
And if
there’s a telegram while I’m away, send it on to Darya Alexandrovna’s
... but no, I shall be back myself.
Yes, I mustn’t think, I must do something, drive somewhere, and most
of all, get out of this house,
Where to?
To Znamenka, the Oblonskys’.
I entreat him to
forgive me. I have given in to him. I have owned myself in fault. What
for? Can’t I live without him?
Office and warehouse. Dental surgeon. Yes, I’ll tell Dolly all
about it. She doesn’t like Vronsky. I shall be sick and ashamed, but
I’ll tell her. She loves me, and I’ll follow her advice. I won’t give
in to him; I won’t let him train me as he pleases. Filippov, bun shop.
They say they send their dough to Petersburg. The Moscow water is so
good for it. Ah, the springs at Mitishtchen, and the pancakes!
Riding, too. Was
that really me, with red hands? How much that seemed to me then
splendid and out of reach has become worthless, while what I had then
has gone out of my reach forever! Could I ever have believed then that
I could come to such humiliation? How conceited and self-satisfied he
will be when he gets my note! But I will show him.... How horrid that
paint smells! Why is it they’re always painting and building? _Modes et
robes_, she read. A man bowed to her. It was Annushka’s husband. “Our
parasites
Our? Why our?
What’s so awful is that one can’t tear up the past by its roots. One
can’t tear it out, but one can hide one’s memory of it. And I’ll hide
it.
Dolly will think
I’m leaving my second husband, and so I certainly must be in the wrong.
As if I cared to be right! I can’t help it!
Love, most likely. They don’t know how dreary it is,
how low.... The boulevard and the children. Three boys running, playing
at horses. Seryozha! And I’m losing everything and not getting him
back. Yes, I’m losing everything, if he doesn’t return. Perhaps he was
late for the train and has come back by now. Longing for humiliation
again!
No, I’ll go to Dolly, and say straight
out to her, I’m unhappy, I deserve this, I’m to blame, but still I’m
unhappy, help me. These horses, this carriage—how loathsome I am to
myself in this carriage—all his; but I won’t see them again.
Is there anyone with her?
Katerina Alexandrovna Levin,
Kitty! Kitty, whom Vronsky was in love with!
the girl
he thinks of with love. He’s sorry he didn’t marry her. But me he
thinks of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything to do with me.
Well, so you’ve not gone away yet? I meant to have come to you,
I had a letter from Stiva today.
We had a telegram too,
He writes that he can’t make out quite what Alexey Alexandrovitch
wants, but he won’t go away without a decisive answer.
I thought you had someone with you. Can I see the letter?
Yes; Kitty,
She stayed in the nursery. She
has been very ill.
So I heard. May I see the letter?
I’ll get it directly. But he doesn’t refuse; on the contrary, Stiva
has hopes,
I haven’t, and indeed I don’t wish it,
What’s this? Does Kitty consider it degrading to meet me?
Perhaps she’s right, too. But it’s not for
her, the girl who was in love with Vronsky, it’s not for her to show me
that, even if it is true. I know that in my position I can’t be
received by any decent woman. I knew that from the first moment I
sacrificed everything to him. And this is my reward! Oh, how I hate
him! And what did I come here for? I’m worse here, more miserable.
And what
am I going to say to Dolly now? Amuse Kitty by the sight of my
wretchedness, submit to her patronizing? No; and besides, Dolly
wouldn’t understand. And it would be no good my telling her. It would
only be interesting to see Kitty, to show her how I despise everyone
and everything, how nothing matters to me now.
I knew all that,
and it doesn’t interest me in the least.
Oh, why so? On the contrary, I have hopes,
When are you going away?
Why does Kitty shrink from me?
Oh, what nonsense! She’s nursing, and things aren’t going right with
her, and I’ve been advising her.... She’s delighted. She’ll be here in
a minute,
Yes, here she
is.
I am so glad to see you,
I should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me. I’m
used to everything. You have been ill? Yes, you are changed,
I came to say good-bye to you,
Oh, when are you going?
Yes, I am very glad to have seen you,
I have
heard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband. He came to
see me, and I liked him exceedingly,
Where is he?
He has gone back to the country,
Remember me to him, be sure you do.
I’ll be sure to!
So good-bye, Dolly.
She’s just the same and just as charming! She’s very lovely!
But there’s something
piteous about her. Awfully piteous!
Yes, there’s something unusual about her today,
When I
went with her into the hall, I fancied she was almost crying.
Where to? Home?
Yes, home,
How they looked at me as something dreadful, incomprehensible, and
curious! What can he be telling the other with such warmth?
Can one ever tell anyone
what one is feeling? I meant to tell Dolly, and it’s a good thing I
didn’t tell her. How pleased she would have been at my misery! She
would have concealed it, but her chief feeling would have been delight
at my being punished for the happiness she envied me for. Kitty, she
would have been even more pleased. How I can see through her! She knows
I was more than usually sweet to her husband. And she’s jealous and
hates me. And she despises me. In her eyes I’m an immoral woman. If I
were an immoral woman I could have made her husband fall in love with
me ... if I’d cared to. And, indeed, I did care to. There’s someone
who’s pleased with himself,
He thought he knew me. Well, he knows me as well as
anyone in the world knows me. I don’t know myself. I know my appetites,
as the French say. They want that dirty ice cream, that they do know
for certain,
We all want what is sweet and nice. If not
sweetmeats, then a dirty ice. And Kitty’s the same—if not Vronsky, then
Levin. And she envies me, and hates me. And we all hate each other. I
Kitty, Kitty me. Yes, that’s the truth. ‘_Tiutkin, coiffeur._’ _Je me
fais coiffer par Tiutkin...._ I’ll tell him that when he comes,
And there’s nothing amusing,
nothing mirthful, really. It’s all hateful. They’re singing for
vespers, and how carefully that merchant crosses himself! as if he were
afraid of missing something. Why these churches and this singing and
this humbug? Simply to conceal that we all hate each other like these
cab drivers who are abusing each other so angrily. Yashvin says, ‘He
wants to strip me of my shirt, and I him of his.’ Yes, that’s the
truth!
Is there an answer?
I’ll see this minute,
I can’t come before ten o’clock.—Vronsky,
And hasn’t the messenger come back?
No,
Then, since it’s so, I know what I must do,
I’ll go to him myself. Before going away forever, I’ll tell
him all. Never have I hated anyone as I hate that man!
Yes, I must go quickly,
Yes, I must go to the railway station, and if he’s not there, then go
there and catch him.
Yes, I
shall be in time.
I don’t want you, Pyotr.
But how about the ticket?
Well, as you like, it doesn’t matter,
Here it is again! Again I understand it all!
Yes; what was the last thing I thought of so clearly?
‘_Tiutkin, coiffeur?_’—no, not that. Yes, of what Yashvin
says, the struggle for existence and hatred is the one thing that holds
men together. No, it’s a useless journey you’re making,
And the dog you’re taking with you will be
no help to you. You can’t get away from yourselves.
Come, he’s found a quicker way,
Count Vronsky and I did
not find that happiness either, though we expected so much from it.
What was it he sought in me? Not love
so much as the satisfaction of vanity.
Yes, there was the triumph of success in him. Of course there was love
too, but the chief element was the pride of success. He boasted of me.
Now that’s over. There’s nothing to be proud of. Not to be proud of,
but to be ashamed of. He has taken from me all he could, and now I am
no use to him. He is weary of me and is trying not to be dishonorable
in his behavior to me. He let that out yesterday—he wants divorce and
marriage so as to burn his ships. He loves me, but how? The zest is
gone, as the English say. That fellow wants everyone to admire him and
is very much pleased with himself,
Yes, there’s not the same
flavor about me for him now. If I go away from him, at the bottom of
his heart he will be glad.
My love keeps growing more passionate and egoistic, while his is
waning and waning, and that’s why we’re drifting apart.
And there’s no help for it. He is everything for me, and I
want him more and more to give himself up to me entirely. And he wants
more and more to get away from me. We walked to meet each other up to
the time of our love, and then we have been irresistibly drifting in
different directions. And there’s no altering that. He tells me I’m
insanely jealous, and I have told myself that I am insanely jealous;
but it’s not true. I’m not jealous, but I’m unsatisfied. But....
If I
could be anything but a mistress, passionately caring for nothing but
his caresses; but I can’t and I don’t care to be anything else. And by
that desire I rouse aversion in him, and he rouses fury in me, and it
cannot be different. Don’t I know that he wouldn’t deceive me, that he
has no schemes about Princess Sorokina, that he’s not in love with
Kitty, that he won’t desert me! I know all that, but it makes it no
better for me. If without loving me, from _duty_ he’ll be good and kind
to me, without what I want, that’s a thousand times worse than
unkindness! That’s—hell! And that’s just how it is. For a long while
now he hasn’t loved me. And where love ends, hate begins. I don’t know
these streets at all. Hills it seems, and still houses, and houses....
And in the houses always people and people.... How many of them, no
end, and all hating each other! Come, let me try and think what I want,
to make me happy. Well? Suppose I am divorced, and Alexey
Alexandrovitch lets me have Seryozha, and I marry Vronsky.
Well, I’m divorced, and become Vronsky’s wife. Well, will
Kitty cease looking at me as she looked at me today? No. And will
Seryozha leave off asking and wondering about my two husbands? And is
there any new feeling I can awaken between Vronsky and me? Is there
possible, if not happiness, some sort of ease from misery? No, no!
Impossible! We are
drawn apart by life, and I make his unhappiness, and he mine, and
there’s no altering him or me. Every attempt has been made, the screw
has come unscrewed. Oh, a beggar woman with a baby. She thinks I’m
sorry for her. Aren’t we all flung into the world only to hate each
other, and so to torture ourselves and each other? Schoolboys
coming—laughing Seryozha?
I thought, too, that I loved
him, and used to be touched by my own tenderness. But I have lived
without him, I gave him up for another love, and did not regret the
exchange till that love was satisfied.
It’s so with
me and Pyotr, and the coachman, Fyodor, and that merchant, and all the
people living along the Volga, where those placards invite one to go,
and everywhere and always,
A ticket to Obiralovka?
Yes,
Katerina Andreevna, she’s got them all, _ma tante!_
Even the child’s hideous and affected,
There’s something
familiar about that hideous peasant,
Do you wish to get out?
It would
be interesting to ask him what meaning he attaches to that,
Yes, what did I stop at? That I couldn’t conceive a position in which
life would not be a misery, that we are all created to be miserable,
and that we all know it, and all invent means of deceiving each other.
And when one sees the truth, what is one to do?
That’s what reason is given man for, to escape from what worries him,
To escape from what worries him,
Yes, I’m very much worried, and that’s what reason was given me for,
to escape; so then one must escape: why not put out the light when
there’s nothing more to look at, when it’s sickening to look at it all?
But how? Why did the conductor run along the footboard, why are they
shrieking, those young men in that train? why are they talking, why are
they laughing? It’s all falsehood, all lying, all humbug, all
cruelty!...
Count Vronsky? They sent up here from the Vronskys just this minute,
to meet Princess Sorokina and her daughter. And what is the coachman
like?
I am very sorry your note did not reach me. I will be home at ten,
Yes, that’s what I expected!
Very good, you can go home then,
No, I won’t let you make me miserable,
Real,
My God! where am I to go?
There,
there, in the
very middle, and I will punish him and escape from everyone and from
myself.
Where am I? What am I doing?
What for?
Lord,
forgive me all!
Sketch of a Survey of the Principles and Forms of Government in Europe
and Russia.
Didn’t I offend him in some way?
You too come to see them off?
No, I’m going away myself, princess. To my brother’s for a holiday. Do
you always see them off?
Oh, that would be impossible!
Is it true that
eight hundred have been sent from us already? Malvinsky wouldn’t
believe me.
More than eight hundred. If you reckon those who have been sent not
directly from Moscow, over a thousand,
There! That’s just what I said!
And it’s true
too, I suppose, that more than a million has been subscribed?
Yes, princess.
What do you say to today’s telegram? Beaten the Turks again.
Yes, so I saw,
Ah, by the way, a splendid young fellow has asked leave to go, and
they’ve made some difficulty, I don’t know why. I meant to ask you; I
know him; please write a note about his case. He’s being sent by
Countess Lidia Ivanovna.
You know Count Vronsky, the notorious one ... is going by this train?
I had heard he was going, but I did not know when. By this train?
I’ve seen him. He’s here: there’s only his mother seeing him off. It’s
the best thing, anyway, that he could do.
Oh, yes, of course.
In the
service of religion, humanity, and our brothers,
to this great cause mother Moscow
dedicates you with her blessing. _Jivio!_
Ah, princess! that was something like!
Capitally, warmly said, wasn’t it? Bravo! And
Sergey Ivanovitch! Why, you ought to have said something—just a few
words, you know, to encourage them; you do that so well,
No, I’m just off.
Where to?
To the country, to my brother’s,
Then you’ll see my wife. I’ve written to her, but you’ll see her
first. Please tell her that they’ve seen me and that it’s ‘all right,’
as the English say. She’ll understand. Oh, and be so good as to tell
her I’m appointed secretary of the committee.... But she’ll understand!
You know, _les petites misères de la vie humaine,_
And Princess Myakaya—not Liza, but
Bibish—is sending a thousand guns and twelve nurses. Did I tell you?
Yes, I heard so,
It’s a pity you’re going away,
Tomorrow
we’re giving a dinner to two who’re setting off—Dimer-Bartnyansky from
Petersburg and our Veslovsky, Grisha. They’re both going. Veslovsky’s
only lately married. There’s a fine fellow for you! Eh, princess?
I can never see these collecting boxes unmoved while I’ve money in my
pocket,
And how about today’s telegram? Fine chaps those
Montenegrins!
You don’t say so!
With all his faults one can’t refuse to do him justice,
What a typically Russian, Slav nature! Only, I’m afraid it won’t
be pleasant for Vronsky to see him. Say what you will, I’m touched by
that man’s fate. Do talk to him a little on the way,
Yes, perhaps, if it happens so.
I never liked him. But this atones for a great deal. He’s not merely
going himself, he’s taking a squadron at his own expense.
Yes, so I heard.
Here he is!
God save the Tsar,
hurrah!
jivio!
Hail to Thee!
Oh, well, everyone’s going. The Servians want help, too. I’m sorry for
them.
Yes, you artillerymen especially are scarce there,
Oh, I wasn’t long in the artillery, maybe they’ll put me into the
infantry or the cavalry.
Into the infantry when they need artillery more than anything?
I wasn’t long in the artillery; I’m a cadet retired,
What different positions they come from, all those fellows who are
going off there,
Well, men are wanted there,
I’m going, you see, taking him as far as Kursk,
Yes, so I heard,
What a noble act on his part!
Yes, after his misfortune, what was there for him to do?
What a terrible thing it was!
Ah, what I have been through! But do get in.... Ah, what I have been
through!
You can’t conceive it! For six weeks he did not speak to
anyone, and would not touch food except when I implored him. And not
for one minute could we leave him alone. We took away everything he
could have used against himself. We lived on the ground floor, but
there was no reckoning on anything. You know, of course, that he had
shot himself once already on her account,
Yes, hers was the fitting end
for such a woman. Even the death she chose was low and vulgar.
It’s not for us to judge, countess,
but I
can understand that it has been very hard for you.
Ah, don’t speak of it! I was staying on my estate, and he was with me.
A note was brought him. He wrote an answer and sent it off. We hadn’t
an idea that she was close by at the station. In the evening I had only
just gone to my room, when my Mary told me a lady had thrown herself
under the train. Something seemed to strike me at once. I knew it was
she. The first thing I said was, he was not to be told. But they’d told
him already. His coachman was there and saw it all. When I ran into his
room, he was beside himself—it was fearful to see him. He didn’t say a
word, but galloped off there. I don’t know to this day what happened
there, but he was brought back at death’s door. I shouldn’t have known
him. _Prostration complète,_ the doctor said. And that was followed
almost by madness. Oh, why talk of it!
It was an awful time! No, say what you will, she was a
bad woman. Why, what is the meaning of such desperate passions? It was
all to show herself something out of the way. Well, and that she did
do. She brought herself to ruin and two good men—her husband and my
unhappy son.
And what did her husband do?
He has taken her daughter. Alexey was ready to agree to anything at
first. Now it worries him terribly that he should have given his own
child away to another man. But he can’t take back his word. Karenin
came to the funeral. But we tried to prevent his meeting Alexey. For
him, for her husband, it was easier, anyway. She had set him free. But
my poor son was utterly given up to her. He had thrown up everything,
his career, me, and even then she had no mercy on him, but of set
purpose she made his ruin complete. No, say what you will, her very
death was the death of a vile woman, of no religious feeling. God
forgive me, but I can’t help hating the memory of her, when I look at
my son’s misery!
But how is he now?
It was a blessing from Providence for us—this Servian war. I’m old,
and I don’t understand the rights and wrongs of it, but it’s come as a
providential blessing to him. Of course for me, as his mother, it’s
terrible; and what’s worse, they say, _ce n’est pas très bien vu à
Pétersbourg_. But it can’t be helped! It was the one thing that could
rouse him. Yashvin—a friend of his—he had lost all he had at cards and
he was going to Servia. He came to see him and persuaded him to go. Now
it’s an interest for him. Do please talk to him a little. I want to
distract his mind. He’s so low-spirited. And as bad luck would have it,
he has toothache too. But he’ll be delighted to see you. Please do talk
to him; he’s walking up and down on that side.
Possibly you didn’t wish to see me,
but
couldn’t I be of use to you?
There’s no one I should less dislike seeing than you,
Excuse me; and there’s nothing in life for me to like.
I quite understand, and I merely meant to offer you my services,
Wouldn’t it be of use to you to have a letter to
Ristitch—to Milan?
Oh, no!
If
you don’t mind, let’s walk on. It’s so stuffy among the carriages. A
letter? No, thank you; to meet death one needs no letters of
introduction. Nor for the Turks....
Yes; but you might find it easier to get into relations, which are
after all essential, with anyone prepared to see you. But that’s as you
like. I was very glad to hear of your intention. There have been so
many attacks made on the volunteers, and a man like you raises them in
public estimation.
My use as a man,
is that life’s worth nothing to me.
And that I’ve enough bodily energy to cut my way into their ranks, and
to trample on them or fall—I know that. I’m glad there’s something to
give my life for, for it’s not simply useless but loathsome to me.
Anyone’s welcome to it.
You will become another man, I predict,
To deliver one’s brother-men from bondage is an aim
worth death and life. God grant you success outwardly—and inwardly
peace,
Yes, as a weapon I may be of some use. But as a man, I’m a wreck,
You have had no telegrams since yesterday’s? Yes, driven back for a
third time, but a decisive engagement expected for tomorrow.
What a shame not to have let us know,
We drove here capitally, and have not put you out,
I’m so dirty. I’m afraid to touch you. I’ve been so busy,
I didn’t know when I should be able to tear myself away. And so you’re
still as ever enjoying your peaceful, quiet happiness,
out of the reach of the current in your peaceful backwater.
Here’s our friend Fyodor Vassilievitch who has succeeded in getting
here at last.
But I’m not a negro, I shall look like a human being when I wash,
Kostya will be delighted. He has gone to his settlement. It’s time he
should be home.
Busy as ever with his farming. It really is a peaceful backwater,
while we in town think of nothing but the Servian war.
Well, how does our friend look at it? He’s sure not to think like other
people.
Oh, I don’t know, like everybody else,
I’ll send to fetch
him. Papa’s staying with us. He’s only just come home from abroad.
It’s Sergey Ivanovitch and Katavasov, a professor,
Oh, that’s a bore in this heat,
No, papa, he’s very nice, and Kostya’s very fond of him,
Oh, I didn’t say anything.
You go to them, darling,
and entertain
them. They saw Stiva at the station; he was quite well. And I must run
to Mitya. As ill-luck would have it, I haven’t fed him since tea. He’s
awake now, and sure to be screaming.
Has he been screaming long, nurse, very long?
But give me him quickly. Oh, nurse, how tiresome you are! There, tie
the cap afterwards, do!
But you can’t manage so, ma’am,
He must be put straight. A-oo!
a-oo!
He knows me, he knows me. In God’s faith, Katerina Alexandrovna,
ma’am, he knew me!
But poor darling, he’s all in perspiration!
What makes you think he knows you?
Impossible! If he knew anyone, he would have known me,
When he wakes up, please God, you shall see for yourself. Then when I
do like this, he simply beams on me, the darling! Simply beams like a
sunny day!
Well, well; then we shall see,
But now go away,
he’s going to sleep.
How hot it is! if God would send a drop of rain,
Yes, yes, sh—sh—sh——
They have got into talk without me,
but still it’s
vexing that Kostya’s out. He’s sure to have gone to the bee-house
again. Though it’s a pity he’s there so often, still I’m glad. It
distracts his mind. He’s become altogether happier and better now than
in the spring. He used to be so gloomy and worried that I felt
frightened for him. And how absurd he is!
What does he keep reading philosophy of some sort for all this year?
If it’s all written in those books, he can understand
them. If it’s all wrong, why does he read them? He says himself that he
would like to believe. Then why is it he doesn’t believe? Surely from
his thinking so much? And he thinks so much from being solitary. He’s
always alone, alone. He can’t talk about it all to us. I fancy he’ll be
glad of these visitors, especially Katavasov. He likes discussions with
them,
I do believe the laundress hasn’t sent the washing yet, and all
the best sheets are in use. If I don’t see to it, Agafea Mihalovna will
give Sergey Ivanovitch the wrong sheets,
Yes, I will arrange it,
Yes, Kostya, an
unbeliever,
Well, an unbeliever then! Better let him always be one than like
Madame Stahl, or what I tried to be in those days abroad. No, he won’t
ever sham anything.
He an unbeliever indeed! With his heart, his dread of offending
anyone, even a child! Everything for others, nothing for himself.
Sergey Ivanovitch simply considers it as Kostya’s duty to be his
steward. And it’s the same with his sister. Now Dolly and her children
are under his guardianship; all these peasants who come to him every
day, as though he were bound to be at their service.
Yes, only be like your father, only like him,
If I do not accept the
answers Christianity gives to the problems of my life, what answers do
I accept?
Without knowing what I am and why I am here, life’s impossible; and
that I can’t know, and so I can’t live,
In infinite time, in infinite matter, in infinite space, is formed a
bubble-organism, and that bubble lasts a while and bursts, and that
bubble is Me.
thank you
thank you
Why is it all being done?
Why am I standing here, making
them work? What are they all so busy for, trying to show their zeal
before me? What is that old Matrona, my old friend, toiling for? (I
doctored her, when the beam fell on her in the fire)
Then she recovered, but today or tomorrow or in ten years she
won’t; they’ll bury her, and nothing will be left either of her or of
that smart girl in the red jacket, who with that skillful, soft action
shakes the ears out of their husks. They’ll bury her and this piebald
horse, and very soon too,
And they will bury her and Fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard
full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders—they will bury
him. He’s untying the sheaves, and giving orders, and shouting to the
women, and quickly setting straight the strap on the moving wheel. And
what’s more, it’s not them alone—me they’ll bury too, and nothing will
be left. What for?
It’ll soon be one, and they’re only beginning the third sheaf,
You put in too much at a time, Fyodor. Do you see—it gets
choked, that’s why it isn’t getting on. Do it evenly.
It’s a high rent; it wouldn’t pay Platon, Konstantin Dmitrievitch,
But how does Kirillov make it pay?
Mituh!
you may be sure he’ll make it pay, Konstantin Dmitrievitch!
He’ll get his share, however he has to squeeze to get it! He’s no mercy
on a Christian. But Uncle Fokanitch
do you suppose he’d flay the skin off a man? Where there’s
debt, he’ll let anyone off. And he’ll not wring the last penny out.
He’s a man too.
But why will he let anyone off?
Oh, well, of course, folks are different. One man lives for his own
wants and nothing else, like Mituh, he only thinks of filling his
belly, but Fokanitch is a righteous man. He lives for his soul. He does
not forget God.
How thinks of God? How does he live for his soul?
Why, to be sure, in truth, in God’s way. Folks are different. Take you
now, you wouldn’t wrong a man....
Yes, yes, good-bye!
Not living for his own wants, but for God? For what God? And could one
say anything more senseless than what he said? He said that one must
not live for one’s own wants, that is, that one must not live for what
we understand, what we are attracted by, what we desire, but must live
for something incomprehensible, for God, whom no one can understand nor
even define. What of it? Didn’t I understand those senseless words of
Fyodor’s? And understanding them, did I doubt of their truth? Did I
think them stupid, obscure, inexact? No, I understood him, and exactly
as he understands the words. I understood them more fully and clearly
than I understand anything in life, and never in my life have I doubted
nor can I doubt about it. And not only I, but everyone, the whole world
understands nothing fully but this, and about this only they have no
doubt and are always agreed.

“And I looked out for miracles, complained that I did not see a miracle
which would convince me. A material miracle would have persuaded me.
And here is a miracle, the sole miracle possible, continually existing,
surrounding me on all sides, and I never noticed it!

“Fyodor says that Kirillov lives for his belly. That’s comprehensible
and rational. All of us as rational beings can’t do anything else but
live for our belly. And all of a sudden the same Fyodor says that one
mustn’t live for one’s belly, but must live for truth, for God, and at
a hint I understand him! And I and millions of men, men who lived ages
ago and men living now—peasants, the poor in spirit and the learned,
who have thought and written about it, in their obscure words saying
the same thing—we are all agreed about this one thing: what we must
live for and what is good. I and all men have only one firm,
incontestable, clear knowledge, and that knowledge cannot be explained
by the reason—it is outside it, and has no causes and can have no
effects.

“If goodness has causes, it is not goodness; if it has effects, a
reward, it is not goodness either. So goodness is outside the chain of
cause and effect.

“And yet I know it, and we all know it.

“What could be a greater miracle than that?

“Can I have found the solution of it all? can my sufferings be over?
Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand,
What have I
discovered?
What is it makes me glad? What have I
discovered?

“I have discovered nothing. I have only found out what I knew. I
understand the force that in the past gave me life, and now too gives
me life. I have been set free from falsity, I have found the Master.

“Of old I used to say that in my body, that in the body of this grass
and of this beetle (there, she didn’t care for the grass, she’s opened
her wings and flown away), there was going on a transformation of
matter in accordance with physical, chemical, and physiological laws.
And in all of us, as well as in the aspens and the clouds and the misty
patches, there was a process of evolution. Evolution from what? into
what?—Eternal evolution and struggle.... As though there could be any
sort of tendency and struggle in the eternal! And I was astonished that
in spite of the utmost effort of thought along that road I could not
discover the meaning of life, the meaning of my impulses and yearnings.
Now I say that I know the meaning of my life: ‘To live for God, for my
soul.’ And this meaning, in spite of its clearness, is mysterious and
marvelous. Such, indeed, is the meaning of everything existing. Yes,
pride,
And not merely pride of intellect, but dulness of intellect. And most
of all, the deceitfulness; yes, the deceitfulness of intellect. The
cheating knavishness of intellect, that’s it,
What should I have been, and how should I have spent my life, if I had
not had these beliefs, if I had not known that I must live for God and
not for my own desires? I should have robbed and lied and killed.
Nothing of what makes the chief happiness of my life would have existed
for me.
I looked for an answer to my question. And thought could not give an
answer to my question—it is incommensurable with my question. The
answer has been given me by life itself, in my knowledge of what is
right and what is wrong. And that knowledge I did not arrive at in any
way, it was given to me as to all men, _given_, because I could not
have got it from anywhere.

“Where could I have got it? By reason could I have arrived at knowing
that I must love my neighbor and not oppress him? I was told that in my
childhood, and I believed it gladly, for they told me what was already
in my soul. But who discovered it? Not reason. Reason discovered the
struggle for existence, and the law that requires us to oppress all who
hinder the satisfaction of our desires. That is the deduction of
reason. But loving one’s neighbor reason could never discover, because
it’s irrational.
That all comes of itself,
and there’s nothing
interesting or important about it because it has always been so, and
always will be so. And it’s all always the same. We’ve no need to think
about that, it’s all ready. But we want to invent something of our own,
and new. So we thought of putting raspberries in a cup, and cooking
them over a candle, and squirting milk straight into each other’s
mouths. That’s fun, and something new, and not a bit worse than
drinking out of cups.
Isn’t it just the same that we do, that I did, searching by the aid of
reason for the significance of the forces of nature and the meaning of
the life of man?
And don’t all the theories of philosophy do the same, trying by the
path of thought, which is strange and not natural to man, to bring him
to a knowledge of what he has known long ago, and knows so certainly
that he could not live at all without it? Isn’t it distinctly to be
seen in the development of each philosopher’s theory, that he knows
what is the chief significance of life beforehand, just as positively
as the peasant Fyodor, and not a bit more clearly than he, and is
simply trying by a dubious intellectual path to come back to what
everyone knows?

“Now then, leave the children to themselves to get things alone and
make their crockery, get the milk from the cows, and so on. Would they
be naughty then? Why, they’d die of hunger! Well, then, leave us with
our passions and thoughts, without any idea of the one God, of the
Creator, or without any idea of what is right, without any idea of
moral evil.

“Just try and build up anything without those ideas!

“We only try to destroy them, because we’re spiritually provided for.
Exactly like the children!

“Whence have I that joyful knowledge, shared with the peasant, that
alone gives peace to my soul? Whence did I get it?

“Brought up with an idea of God, a Christian, my whole life filled with
the spiritual blessings Christianity has given me, full of them, and
living on those blessings, like the children I did not understand them,
and destroy, that is try to destroy, what I live by. And as soon as an
important moment of life comes, like the children when they are cold
and hungry, I turn to Him, and even less than the children when their
mother scolds them for their childish mischief, do I feel that my
childish efforts at wanton madness are reckoned against me.

“Yes, what I know, I know not by reason, but it has been given to me,
revealed to me, and I know it with my heart, by faith in the chief
thing taught by the church.

“The church! the church!
But can I believe in all the church teaches?
The Creation? But how did I explain existence? By existence? By
nothing? The devil and sin. But how do I explain evil?... The
atonement?...

“But I know nothing, nothing, and I can know nothing but what has been
told to me and all men.
Do I
not know that that is infinite space, and that it is not a round arch?
But, however I screw up my eyes and strain my sight, I cannot see it
not round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing about infinite
space, I am incontestably right when I see a solid blue dome, and more
right than when I strain my eyes to see beyond it.
Can this be faith?
My God, I thank Thee!
The mistress sent me. Your brother has come, and
some gentleman with him.
With my brother there will be none of that aloofness there always used
to be between us, there will be no disputes; with Kitty there shall
never be quarrels; with the visitor, whoever he may be, I will be
friendly and nice; with the servants, with Ivan, it will all be
different.
Your honor must keep to the right and mind that stump,
Please don’t touch and don’t teach me!
Uncle Kostya! mamma’s coming, and grandfather, and Sergey Ivanovitch,
and someone else,
Who is he?
An awfully terrible person! And he does like this with his arms,
Old or young?
Oh, I hope it’s not a tiresome person!
No, whatever I do, I won’t argue and give utterance to my ideas
lightly,
She has taken Mitya to Kolok
She meant to
have him out there because it’s so hot indoors,
She rushes about from place to place with him,
I advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar.
She meant to come to the bee-house. She thought you would be there. We
are going there,
Well, and what are you doing?
Oh, nothing special. Busy as usual with the land,
Well, and what about you? Come for long? We have been expecting you
for such a long time.
Only for a fortnight. I’ve a great deal to do in Moscow.
Well, have there been reviews of your book?
No one is interested in that now, and I less than anyone,
Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a shower,
It was jolly of you to make up your mind to come,
I’ve been meaning to a long while. Now we shall have some discussion,
we’ll see to that. Have you been reading Spencer?
No, I’ve not finished reading him,
But I don’t need him
now.
How’s that? that’s interesting. Why so?
I mean that I’m fully convinced that the solution of the problems that
interest me I shall never find in him and his like. Now....
But we’ll talk later on,
If we’re going to the bee-house,
it’s this way, along this little path,
Can it have been only a momentary mood, and will it pass and leave no
trace?
Do you know, Kostya, with whom Sergey Ivanovitch traveled on his way
here?
with Vronsky! He’s going to Servia.
And not alone; he’s taking a squadron out with him at his own
expense,
That’s the right thing for him,
Are volunteers still
going out then?
I should think so! You should have seen what was going on at the
station yesterday!
Well, what is one to make of it? For mercy’s sake, do explain to me,
Sergey Ivanovitch, where are all those volunteers going, whom are they
fighting with?
With the Turks,
But who has declared war on the Turks?—Ivan Ivanovitch Ragozov and
Countess Lidia Ivanovna, assisted by Madame Stahl?
No one has declared war, but people sympathize with their neighbors’
sufferings and are eager to help them,
But the prince is not speaking of help,
but of war. The prince says that
private persons cannot take part in war without the permission of the
government.
Kostya, mind, that’s a bee! Really, they’ll sting us!
But that’s not a bee, it’s a wasp,
Well now, well, what’s your own theory?
Why have not
private persons the right to do so?
Oh, my theory’s this: war is on one side such a beastly, cruel, and
awful thing, that no one man, not to speak of a Christian, can
individually take upon himself the responsibility of beginning wars;
that can only be done by a government, which is called upon to do this,
and is driven inevitably into war. On the other hand, both political
science and common sense teach us that in matters of state, and
especially in the matter of war, private citizens must forego their
personal individual will.
But the point is, my dear fellow, that there may be cases when the
government does not carry out the will of the citizens and then the
public asserts its will,
You don’t put the matter in its true light. There is no question here
of a declaration of war, but simply the expression of a human Christian
feeling. Our brothers, one with us in religion and in race, are being
massacred. Even supposing they were not our brothers nor
fellow-Christians, but simply children, women, old people, feeling is
aroused and Russians go eagerly to help in stopping these atrocities.
Fancy, if you were going along the street and saw drunken men beating a
woman or a child—I imagine you would not stop to inquire whether war
had been declared on the men, but would throw yourself on them, and
protect the victim.
But I should not kill them,
Yes, you would kill them.
I don’t know. If I saw that, I might give way to my impulse of the
moment, but I can’t say beforehand. And such a momentary impulse there
is not, and there cannot be, in the case of the oppression of the
Slavonic peoples.
Possibly for you there is not; but for others there is,
There are traditions still
extant among the people of Slavs of the true faith suffering under the
yoke of the ‘unclean sons of Hagar.’ The people have heard of the
sufferings of their brethren and have spoken.
Perhaps so,
but I don’t see it. I’m one of the
people myself, and I don’t feel it.
Here am I too,
I’ve been staying abroad and
reading the papers, and I must own, up to the time of the Bulgarian
atrocities, I couldn’t make out why it was all the Russians were all of
a sudden so fond of their Slavonic brethren, while I didn’t feel the
slightest affection for them. I was very much upset, thought I was a
monster, or that it was the influence of Carlsbad on me. But since I
have been here, my mind’s been set at rest. I see that there are people
besides me who’re only interested in Russia, and not in their Slavonic
brethren. Here’s Konstantin too.
Personal opinions mean nothing in such a case,
it’s not a matter of personal opinions when all Russia—the
whole people—has expressed its will.
But excuse me, I don’t see that. The people don’t know anything about
it, if you come to that,
Oh, papa!... how can you say that? And last Sunday in church?
Please give me a cloth,
Why, it’s not possible that all....
But what was it in church on Sunday? The priest had been told to read
that. He read it. They didn’t understand a word of it. Then they were
told that there was to be a collection for a pious object in church;
well, they pulled out their halfpence and gave them, but what for they
couldn’t say.
The people cannot help knowing; the sense of their own destinies is
always in the people, and at such moments as the present that sense
finds utterance,
That’s so, no doubt,
Here, then, ask him. He knows nothing about it and thinks nothing,
Have you heard about the war, Mihalitch?
What they read in the church? What do you think about it?
Ought we to fight for the Christians?
What should we think? Alexander Nikolaevitch our Emperor has thought
for us; he thinks for us indeed in all things. It’s clearer for him to
see. Shall I bring a bit more bread? Give the little lad some more?
I don’t need to ask,
we have seen and are
seeing hundreds and hundreds of people who give up everything to serve
a just cause, come from every part of Russia, and directly and clearly
express their thought and aim. They bring their halfpence or go
themselves and say directly what for. What does it mean?
It means, to my thinking,
that among eighty millions of people there can always be found not
hundreds, as now, but tens of thousands of people who have lost caste,
ne’er-do-wells, who are always ready to go anywhere—to Pogatchev’s
bands, to Khiva, to Servia....
I tell you that it’s not a case of hundreds or of ne’er-do-wells, but
the best representatives of the people!
And what of the subscriptions? In this case it is a whole
people directly expressing their will.
That word ‘people’ is so vague,
Parish clerks, teachers,
and one in a thousand of the peasants, maybe, know what it’s all about.
The rest of the eighty millions, like Mihalitch, far from expressing
their will, haven’t the faintest idea what there is for them to express
their will about. What right have we to say that this is the people’s
will?
Oh, if you want to learn the spirit of the people by arithmetical
computation, of course it’s very difficult to arrive at it. And voting
has not been introduced among us and cannot be introduced, for it does
not express the will of the people; but there are other ways of
reaching that. It is felt in the air, it is felt by the heart. I won’t
speak of those deep currents which are astir in the still ocean of the
people, and which are evident to every unprejudiced man; let us look at
society in the narrow sense. All the most diverse sections of the
educated public, hostile before, are merged in one. Every division is
at an end, all the public organs say the same thing over and over
again, all feel the mighty torrent that has overtaken them and is
carrying them in one direction.
Yes, all the newspapers do say the same thing,
That’s true. But so it is the same thing that all the frogs croak
before a storm. One can hear nothing for them.
Frogs or no frogs, I’m not the editor of a paper and I don’t want to
defend them; but I am speaking of the unanimity in the intellectual
world,
Well, about that unanimity, that’s another thing, one may say,
There’s my son-in-law, Stepan Arkadyevitch, you know him.
He’s got a place now on the committee of a commission and something or
other, I don’t remember. Only there’s nothing to do in it—why, Dolly,
it’s no secret!—and a salary of eight thousand. You try asking him
whether his post is of use, he’ll prove to you that it’s most
necessary. And he’s a truthful man too, but there’s no refusing to
believe in the utility of eight thousand roubles.
Yes, he asked me to give a message to Darya Alexandrovna about the
post,
So it is with the unanimity of the press. That’s been explained to me:
as soon as there’s war their incomes are doubled. How can they help
believing in the destinies of the people and the Slavonic races ... and
all that?
I don’t care for many of the papers, but that’s unjust,
I would only make one condition,
Alphonse
Karr said a capital thing before the war with Prussia: ‘You consider
war to be inevitable? Very good. Let everyone who advocates war be
enrolled in a special regiment of advance-guards, for the front of
every storm, of every attack, to lead them all!’
A nice lot the editors would make!
But they’d run,
they’d only be in the way.
Oh, if they ran away, then we’d have grape-shot or Cossacks with whips
behind them,
But that’s a joke, and a poor one too, if you’ll excuse my saying so,
prince,
I don’t see that it was a joke, that....
Every member of society is called upon to do his own special work,
And men of thought are doing their work when they express
public opinion. And the single-hearted and full expression of public
opinion is the service of the press and a phenomenon to rejoice us at
the same time. Twenty years ago we should have been silent, but now we
have heard the voice of the Russian people, which is ready to rise as
one man and ready to sacrifice itself for its oppressed brethren; that
is a great step and a proof of strength.
But it’s not only making a sacrifice, but killing Turks,
The people make sacrifices and are ready to make sacrifices
for their soul, but not for murder,
For their soul? That’s a most puzzling expression for a natural
science man, do you understand? What sort of thing is the soul?
Oh, you know!
No, by God, I haven’t the faintest idea!
‘I bring not peace, but a sword,’ says Christ,
That’s so, no doubt,
Ah, my dear fellow, you’re defeated, utterly defeated!
No, I can’t argue with them,
they wear impenetrable
armor, while I’m naked.
Be princes and rule over us. Gladly we promise complete
submission. All the labor, all humiliations, all sacrifices we take
upon ourselves; but we will not judge and decide.
Katerina Alexandrovna?
We thought she was with you,
And Mitya?
In the copse, he must be, and the nurse with him.
Can it have been struck?
My God! my God! not on them!
Alive? Unhurt? Thank God!
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? I can’t think how you can be so
reckless!
It wasn’t my fault, really. We were just meaning to go, when he made
such a to-do that we had to change him. We were just....
Well, thank God! I don’t know what I’m saying!
Yes, looking at the
sky, I thought that the dome that I see is not a deception, and then I
thought something, I shirked facing something,
But whatever
it was, there can be no disproving it! I have but to think, and all
will come clear!
Come, look, look!
Agafea
Mihalovna’s right. He knows us!
Well, I am glad you are beginning to love him,
I am so glad! It had begun to distress
me. You said you had no feeling for him.
No; did I say that? I only said I was disappointed.
What! disappointed in him?
Not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; I had expected more. I
had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise.
And then instead of that—disgust, pity....
And most of all, at there being far more apprehension and pity than
pleasure. Today, after that fright during the storm, I understand how I
love him.
Were you very much frightened?
So was I too, but I feel it
more now that it’s over. I’m going to look at the oak. How nice
Katavasov is! And what a happy day we’ve had altogether. And you’re so
nice with Sergey Ivanovitch, when you care to be.... Well, go back to
them. It’s always so hot and steamy here after the bath.
Well, what is it perplexes me?
Yes, the one unmistakable,
incontestable manifestation of the Divinity is the law of right and
wrong, which has come into the world by revelation, and which I feel in
myself, and in the recognition of which—I don’t make myself, but
whether I will or not—I am made one with other men in one body of
believers, which is called the church. Well, but the Jews, the
Mohammedans, the Confucians, the Buddhists—what of them?
Can these hundreds of
millions of men be deprived of that highest blessing without which life
has no meaning?
But what am I questioning?
I am
questioning the relation to Divinity of all the different religions of
all mankind. I am questioning the universal manifestation of God to all
the world with all those misty blurs. What am I about? To me
individually, to my heart has been revealed a knowledge beyond all
doubt, and unattainable by reason, and here I am obstinately trying to
express that knowledge in reason and words.

“Don’t I know that the stars don’t move?
But looking at the movements of the stars, I can’t
picture to myself the rotation of the earth, and I’m right in saying
that the stars move.

“And could the astronomers have understood and calculated anything, if
they had taken into account all the complicated and varied motions of
the earth? All the marvelous conclusions they have reached about the
distances, weights, movements, and deflections of the heavenly bodies
are only founded on the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies about a
stationary earth, on that very motion I see before me now, which has
been so for millions of men during long ages, and was and will be
always alike, and can always be trusted. And just as the conclusions of
the astronomers would have been vain and uncertain if not founded on
observations of the seen heavens, in relation to a single meridian and
a single horizon, so would my conclusions be vain and uncertain if not
founded on that conception of right, which has been and will be always
alike for all men, which has been revealed to me as a Christian, and
which can always be trusted in my soul. The question of other religions
and their relations to Divinity I have no right to decide, and no
possibility of deciding.
Oh, you haven’t gone in then?
What is it? you’re not worried about anything?
She understands,
she knows what I’m thinking about.
Shall I tell her or not? Yes, I’ll tell her.
Kostya! do something for me,
go into the corner room and
see if they’ve made it all right for Sergey Ivanovitch. I can’t very
well. See if they’ve put the new wash stand in it.
Very well, I’ll go directly,
No, I’d better not speak of it,
It is a secret for me alone, of vital importance for me,
and not to be put into words.

“This new feeling has not changed me, has not made me happy and
enlightened all of a sudden, as I had dreamed, just like the feeling
for my child. There was no surprise in this either. Faith—or not
faith—I don’t know what it is—but this feeling has come just as
imperceptibly through suffering, and has taken firm root in my soul.

“I shall go on in the same way, losing my temper with Ivan the
coachman, falling into angry discussions, expressing my opinions
tactlessly; there will be still the same wall between the holy of
holies of my soul and other people, even my wife; I shall still go on
scolding her for my own terror, and being remorseful for it; I shall
still be as unable to understand with my reason why I pray, and I shall
still go on praying; but my life now, my whole life apart from anything
that can happen to me, every minute of it is no more meaningless, as it
was before, but it has the positive meaning of goodness, which I have
the power to put into it.
